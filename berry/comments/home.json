"title":"Little problem...",
"text":"I downloaded and installed bbtether, but it did not work out-of-the-box for me. I'm using linux mint \"katya\", with a bold 9900 (os 7) on rogers; it would not connect until I edited the \"connect\" command in the \"conf/rogers\" script. This command used the relative path name for \"conf/rogers-chat\", but I had to modify that to the full / absolute pathname to that file in order for the connect command to succeed. It has worked flawlessly ever since; thanks for this excellent software!\n",

Ping tests show traffic but I had no DNS functions despite the status showing the correct DNS servers. I had no joy adding DNS to any of the several involved scripts (but I'm no guru). Just editing /etc/resolv.conf isn't a solution because Because Network Mgr overwrites it when reconnecting to my LAN. I solved this by writing my own Berry_resolve.conf with the correct nameserver entries, and creating a sript to launch instead of dropping to a root shell all the time: (provided you're a sudoer)\n\nsudo cp /home/user1/Berry_resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf\nsudo bbtether\n\nThis works for me, and despite the connection seeming to freeze randomly without disconnection, it works enough for me to remote into my servers and fix user issues without driving several hours from boonie campgrounds.\nThanks very much for making the package available, and for he helpful comments posted.",

Any/all dependancies which come up when you 'rpm -ivh berry4all*rpm' are available through yum archives for Fedora 11, which is convenient.    Only downside for me is the connection seemed a bit slow (and you have to fix the /etc/resolv.conf or add a device in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts  to let the Linux system do nslookups for hosts and domains; you need to click in Firefox File Work-Offline to make it online again).    By comparison, I also used the Blackberry/Verizon CD to install my wife's Storm on her Windows Vista computer as a Broadband device, and it is a lot faster (including I also tested my Storm on her computer and likewise was faster).  So I don't know if there is anything different about setting it up as Broadband per say, verses just a tethered modem?  Maybe someone can explain.  \n",

It just says \"Contacting [URL]\" in the browser status bar. Is this a dns issue? could i specify other dns servers than the \"peerdns\" that's in the script? or is it a blackberry proxy service issue? not sure if anyone has seen this before.\n",

"text":"EVERYONE, I just bought a new Blackberry Storm 2 months ago. I was paying $99 for unlimited calling, $30 for unlimited data and $30 for the tethering package. I followed the complete instructions for listed for Ubuntu 9.04. Connected my BB performed the initial scan, removed my battery. \n\nReconnected, BAM my Storm was up and running under ubuntu. Full IP address, Charging for battery and more. You will notice the browser will error out, make sure to uncheck the work off line box and go to your favorite site. \n\nAs a result, I have just cancelled my $30 tether package and can now use my linux partition as appose to the Vista none sense from before. IT REALLY WORKS!!!!!",
