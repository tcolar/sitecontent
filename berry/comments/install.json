"text":"I have spent 3-4 days, trying to get thethering working. I have installed most recent DM. I saw that people were having problems using BT connection for tethering BB. So I disabled Bluetooth on the BB, removed the paired BT (BB) device from the PC. Now the Control Panel / Devices doesn?t show any exclamation mark. However, when I start DM, it doesn?t show IP modem option, this is what I see (might be called differently in English version)\n\nBB Media Sync, Application Loader, Restore / Recovery, Transferring data from one BB to the other, Synchronization.\n\nShould IP modem be shown as well? It doesn?t show for me. I dunno why, I even installed the USB / Modem drivers from RIM site:\n\nBlackBerry - Software Downloads 2\n\nI tried using manual tethering settings based on this site:\nhttp://www.l0pht.com/dildog/bb-win-tether/index.html\n\nThe most basic problem I face is that when I get to this point ?You'll get a dialog that looks like this (this dialog doesn't have COM4, because i wrote this tutorial after installing the modem...)? ? this window that?s shown on the webpage I never get. When I click next, it just installs modem, and list of devices shows Standard 33600 bps modem with a yellow exclamation mark next to it. I cannot edit properties, and I cannot chose port. All this, even though Virtual Serial Ports are available shown in Step 2.\n",

"text":"fedora 11 x86_64, blackberry bold 9700, usb tether. The device is seen usb side. It appears to be seen by B4A as it claims a ppp0 device is connected etc. I see no ppp0 anywhere on the system. Ultimately is just times out never receiving an IP, never showing Modem Mode on the phone, and no ppp0 device or similar ever appearing. Right after it times out one of the CPU cores goes to 100% and will continue at that until I tell it Modem->Disconnect even though it reports its already disconnected. Ive seen no 'errors' in messages, in the verbose output nor the likes of AVC denials etc. Not sure whats wrong but my 2 cents is F11 x86_64 + 9700 == doesnt work.  Any suggestions?\n",
