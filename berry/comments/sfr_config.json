Tried all 4 USB ports, BB charges but is not detected.\n\nTried taking out battery and rebooting BB.\n\nI am pretty sure that I have all the required packages installed unless there is something I am missing. I installed all the packages required in the install instructions. \n\nVery frustrated, spent 3 hours reading through other posting found on google search. Seems to work out hassle free for others.\n\nNothing in lsusb or dmesg output.\n\nIf I can't get it to work, may purchase bluetooth dongle and use NetworkManager applet in Ubuntu which is also reported to work well for tethering.",

"title":"tmobile switch from 2G to 3G on the fly",
"text":"I was curious to see what would happen if I raised the speed to 3G in the middle of a 2G connection. And guess what? It worked. After connecting at 2G, I switch to 3G and run another speed test. The difference is huge; HOWEVER, it seems as though Tmobile is detecting my 3G connection and then cut me off! \n\nTmobile's doesn't allow 3G speeds for tethering. Personally, I think it is a policy decision to force users to buy into their network card that you have to pay $59 per month.\n\nDoes anyone have a way to keep the speed at 3G and somehow fool Tmobile into thinking it's a 2G connection???\n\nThanks,\nGil@Vidals.net\n",
