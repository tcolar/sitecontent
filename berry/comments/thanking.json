I changed \"rules\" so I don't have to run as ROOT, and I hid the directory by renaming to \".bbtether\" so I don't have it cluttering the default view of my home directory.  Works like a charm!  Only improvement would be a neat launcher so I can just click in from my desktop and go, without having to open a terminal session.  In all, a fantastic little app!  Almost as easy to use as BB Desktop 5.0 for Windows - almost.\n\nCheers,\n\nJon",

"title":"Tmobile Bold 9700 Speed at 1031 Kbps / 94 Kbps",
"text":"I struggled to get barry4all to work until I lowered the speed of my network connection on my blackberry down to 2G. After that I could use berry4all.\n\nI was curious to see what would happen if I raised the speed to 3G in the middle of a 2G connection. And guess what? It worked. After connecting at 2G, I switch to 3G and run another speed test. The difference is huge; HOWEVER, it seems as though Tmobile is detecting my 3G connection and then cut me off! \n\nTmobile's doesn't allow 3G speeds for tethering. Personally, I think it is a policy decision to force users to buy into their network card that you have to pay $59 per month.\n\nDoes anyone have a way to keep the speed at 3G and somehow fool Tmobile into thinking it's a 2G connection???\n\nThanks,\nGil@Vidals.net\n",
