======Berry4All: Compiling pyusb from sources on OSX======
====Developer tools====
You will need this to compile anything.

If you run''gcc'' in a terminal and get "command not found", you need to install the compiler (OSX developer tools)):

You can either find them **on the Tiger/Leopard DVD's, or**:
  * for leopard, xcode 3:
[[http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html]]
  * for tiger, xcode 2.5: (that was a pain to find !)
[[http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/xcode_2.5_developer_tools/xcode25_8m2558_developerdvd.dmg]]

You will need to register/login (free) to Apple dev. connection to download those.

You also need to install the libusb **SDK** first:

Download and install xcode
=====PyUSB=====
Install pyusb from sources:

Download pyusb ([[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=145185&package_id=159677]])
and extract it.

Then run those commands in a terminal (setup.py will run the compilation)
<code | In terminal>
cd pyusb
sudo python setup.py install
</code>

=====Sharing your binary=====
**It would be great if you could send me your compile usb.so** (in pyusb/build folder), so i could add it to the universal binary.
This way nobody would have to compile it manually again.
