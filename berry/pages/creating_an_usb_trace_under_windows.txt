======Berry4all: Creating an USB trace under Windows======
Sometimes there is no way to figure out what the Blackberry software is doing "special" for a particular device or setup.
Since the Balckberry software is closed sources, the only way to figure out what's going on is to run an USB trace of the Blackberry software and then analyze it.

To achieve this will we use a nice, though not very intuitive, free little USB sniffer called SnoopyPro(a.k.a UsbSnoop).

Tip: if you are on linux and will run the windows emulator image from there, this might be easier:

=====Preparing the box=====
  * Get a hold of a Windows(2000 or XP easier) machine or emulator image (VirtualBox works well for this, as well as VMWare or Parallels on OSX - **make sure the emulator has USB support**).
  * Start windows and make sure whatever we want to trace is working (for example if we are testing tethering, make sure tethering is working) using the relevant Blackberry tools (ex: RIM Desktop Manager).
  * Once we have it working under windows, we are ready to install the sniffer.
=====Installing SnoopyPro=====
  * Download it at [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/usbsnoop/]] and install.
  * Make sure your BB is plugged, then start USBSnoop
  * Click **File/Unpack drivers** (see [[#screenshot1]])
=====Running a trace=====
  * Start SnoopyPro again, it should show the "devices" window
  * Find the blackberry device (**Vendor ID=0xFCA**) - **there might be multiple 0xFCA entries**, **right click it and select "install service"**, then again **right click it and select "Install and restart".** (see [[#screenshot2]]
  * Then **unplug/replug the Blackberry**, if it works you should see the Main SnoopyPro window starting a log and reporting on reading packets. (see [[#screenshot2]])

  * It's now running the trace, you can close the "device" window.
  * Now run whatever needs to be traced (Ex: tethering modem connect, then disconnect.) (see [[#screenshot3]])

  * When done press the **Stop** Button in SnoopyPro, you should now see the logged data.
  * **Click in the menu tools/analyze**, this will enhance the log data. (see [[#screenshot4]])

  * Then press the **Save** Button and save the log(s) to a file. (see [[#screenshot5]])

  * **You will also need to save each log(s) into a text document, because otherwise i can only look at them on windows which I don't usually have on hand, here is how to save the logs in text format:**
  * In SnoopyPro, with the log open, click "**Edit -> Select all**", then click "**View -> Expand**", then "**Edit -> select all**" again, then "**Edit -> Copy**".
  * Then open **Wordpad** (**NOT notepad**), and paste in there, save as a text file (ex: USBLog1.txt)


  * Then **email all the logs(.usblog and .txt), preferably zipped, to me at mailto:tcolar@colar.net**
