berry4all script and settings -- US Cellular
by P.K. Carlisle 2009-11-03
Tested and working on U.S. Cellular with a Blackberry 8330 Curve

This was tested and working November, 2009 with

  - a US Cellular Blackberry Curve 8330 OS version 4.5.0.138
  - OpenSUSE 11.1
  - kernel 2.6.27.90-135 default
  - Gnome 2.24.1
  - Python 2.6.0-2.21.1
  - ppp 0.3.23-5.2
  - barry-gui 0.14-24.1
  - barry-util 0.14-24.1
  - libbarry0 0.14-23.1
  - barry-opensync 0.15-cvs20090410
  - berry4all 0.3j

(all of these barry apps might not be necessary to making the Berry run as modem)
**Note from berry4all author: It's better not to have them as they might conflict**

* The berry4all FAQs suggests updating /etc/resolv.conf with a nameserver.
I agree, with one twist:
If you will occasionally use the PC with wired high speed internet OR a different
internet access method other than the Berry, replace the name server in 
/etc/resolv.conf as follows:
#try opendns
nameserver 208.67.222.222

This name server is for OpenDNS.  Registration is free.  Using the wired 
high speed ISP's nameserver will make the Berry fail to resolve host names, 
BUT using the mobile provider's nameserver will makes the wired high speed
connection fail the same way.  Both will use OpenDNS with equal facility.

* US Cellular has no way to automatically check data usage at present.  You have to call tech support and ask for a usage update.

* The bump up to the premium (5GB) limit is $15 extra on top of $25 BIS data.

* Don't expect any tech support help for Linux from US Cellular tech support.

* US Cellular does not support any other phones as modems.

* US Cellular's dial up process for berry-as-modem is a passthrough according
to Us Cellular tech support, meaning that they don't know nuthin' about nuthin'.
Therefore, the defaults listed for Windows' Desktop Manager at blackberry.com
might be a generally good resource for tweaking settings.

* Tradition dictates that I post this while tethered with the Berry, so I did.

Regards.
