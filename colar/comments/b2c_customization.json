"title":"Great help for new E commerce developers",
"text":"I recently started as a Java portal developer for E commerce applications. Your website helps a lot in terms of understanding how java things work on SAP side. With an environment half setup at my work place, and not able to figure out what purpose the NWDI served, your tutorial with using eclipse and other tools which a Java/J2EE developer is familiar with is just great.\n\nThanks ",
