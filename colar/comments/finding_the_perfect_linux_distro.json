"text":"Very nice article. I switched to linux about six months back or so. Feisty fawn being my first linux distro ever.\nSo learning so much about other distros is really great. The second one I have tried so far is damnsmalllinux on my pen drive. You have probably heard of it before. Great for embedding i guess but as far as desktops are concerned, i am pretty sure ubuntu is a better choice for me. Am gonna try foresight though.",
