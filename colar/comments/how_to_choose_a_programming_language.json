"text":"Interesting read, thanks for sharing your experiences...\n \nWe've been using Groovy at Qarbon for the last few years to handle scripting and automation tasks. Its a great tool for Java developers and really fun to work with. A great replacement for shell scripts or batch files that become cross platform. The Ant integration is really powerful too, using the AntBuilder class.\n\nHave just played a bit with Grails would like to research it some more one of these days.\n\nAndrew Branch\n",
