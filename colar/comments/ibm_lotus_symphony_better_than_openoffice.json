"text":"Hi, we're currently evaluating the 2 solutions as candidates to replacing MS Office solution on around 5K PCs.\n\nHere's our perception of it:\n\n* It's faster than OpenOffice, not super fast(based on eclipse), but definitely faster than OpenOffice.\n\nWRONG! Symphony is bloated, and much SLOWER than OO.\n\n> Overall, OO and Symphony seem to be as fast. The only real problem seems to be with the presentation tool which is very slow to display the previews of the slides in the left toolbar in both OO and Symphony even on a standard PC.\n\n* It seem to be lighter and simpler to use (nice UI).\n\nNO COMMENTS\n\n> The UI is in fact a little different in Symphony than OO. The contextual toolbar feature is nice to use.\n\n* It works on almost all platforms (Linux, OSX, Windows) which is a big plus.\n\nSo does Open Office!\n\n> AGREE\n\n* It seem the compatibility with other formats is VERY good (PDF, MsWord, OpenOffice, RTF etc...).\n\nIt is BETTER with Open Office!\n\n> Wrong in the case of excel compatibility, Symphony has a beginning of compatibility with excel macros. IBM claims a 80% compatibility with excel macros. The fact is you have a chance that your excel macros work in Symphony, they never work in OO 3.3\nAlso the styles seem to be handled in a better way by Symphony.\n\n\n* It does Text processing(~Word), Spreadsheets(~Excell) and Presentation(~Powerpoint).\n\nSo does Open Office!\n\n> AGREE\n\n* Plugins: Various plugins can be installed/developed, for example there is an \"export to html\" plugin that does a VERY good job.\n\nOpen Office has a MUCH larger collection of add-ons.\n\n> Right, Symphony also doesn't seem to be compatible with OO plugin :-(\n",
