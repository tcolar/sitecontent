"text":"I use ubuntu mate LTS and I have to do this fix on my 8440p to get it to boot or else once it gets to desktop the screen just stays black. Installing and everything from usb went fine originally i didn't run into problems until i got to the desktop. It would show up for 1 second and then go black. I just had to change the grub config for some reason and my model doesn't even have the nvidia card it's just the base model with onboard intel graphics.",
