"text":"I do understand that Linksys AS A COMPANY might be more supportive of Linux than D-link is.\nHowever the D-Link product is far superior however you cut it.\nAlso I did want to install an oensource firmware on the Netgear, but at the time there wasn't one, and the guys from openrouter told me (at the time) this device hardware was too limited(memory) to be worth dealing with.

"text":"The Linksys routers are for the linux enthusiast b/c they have enough RAM on them to support custom, open-source firmware like Tomato. These firmware operate much faster and are immensely informative and customizable. \nOut of the box, the D-Link wins for sure. However, if you really want to take control of your router, you'll need a better (open-source) firmware like Tomato.",

"text":"I bought a DIR-655 after my POS Linksys WRT54GL went tits up. I even tried upgrading the firmware to Sveasoft Talisman to no avail. The hardware was bad. The D-Link is rock-solid and fast. Haven't re-booted the router in several months. I was having to re-boot the Linksys every few *hours*. D-Link firmware is a pleasure to use. Excellent product. Good-bye to Linksys.\n",
