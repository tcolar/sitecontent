Tmobile I think makes it hard on purpose to sort through these plans to allow a creative linux user to make things work.\n",

"title":"Tethering a BlackBerry to Ubuntu 8.04 with Alltel.",
"text":"I followed this tutorial, but I struggled for a while with the pppd scripts due to alltel not allowing APN.\n\nSo here's how to get your tether working on Ubuntu if you have Alltel. I have an 8830 WE but this probably works with others as well.\n\n1. Follow the above articles instructions until it gets to the section on PPP scripts. \n\n2. Edit /etc/wvdial.conf to:\n\n[Modem0]\nModem = /dev/pts/x(this number tends to change)\nBaud = 115200\nSetVolume = 0\nDial Command = ATDT\nInit1 = ATZ\nFlowControl = Hardware (CRTSCTS)\n[Dialer blackberry]\nUsername = 10digitphone#@bb.alltel.net\nPassword = alltel\nPhone = #777\nStupid Mode = 1\nInherits = Modem0\n\n3. Connect your BB and run \"sudo bcharge\" in a terminal. If you get an error saying possible Kernel conflict thats ok. \n\n4. Run \"sudo XmBlackBerry\" then when it finishes it should say \"ip_modem.c:NewIpModem [...] '/dev/pts/3'\" That last digit may change each time you connect your BB so you'll have to edit the /etc/wvdial.conf file accordingly before you run wvdial.\n\n5. Open a seperate terminal and run \"sudo wvdial blackberry\" If it displays an IP address then you're in business!\n\nAny questions email me chainy1 at gmail",
