"text":"Can I get a copy of your tracings, I have asked for them this morning from True, but did not get an answer. My first two scans have had problems and would like to have the instructions and paper that you used to send to Rob at True. Not sure exactly where or how to measure. These are my first attempts at purchasing True VH. I just don't want more problems I am looking forward to my first good pair at the third try! Thanks",
