# 2015-2016 NHL Predictions

Here is how I see each Division shake up:

### Atlantic
This divsion sucks, they don't deserve 3 playoff spots.

- **1 Lightning** (X)

Ok, the lightning don't suck, I see no reason why they would not win this division again.

- **2 Canadiens** (X)

The Canadiens overachieved and where bailed out by Price. I don't see this team go far in the playoffs anytime soon,
but in this division they should still be good for second.

- **3 Red wings** (X)

I feel the red wings should not make the playoffs this year, but again not much worthy competition here, maybe the panthers take their spot ?

- **4 Panthers**

I think the panthers keep getting better, and I think they have a shot at taking Detroit's spot, but they seem to have a hard time taking the next step.

- **5 Bruins**

I don't know what they are doing and don't like the moves they made, I see them regressing quite a bit and missing the playoffs. 

- **6 Senators**

I don't think they can repeat what they did last year, they might overtake the Bruins, but I don't see them making the playoffs.

- **7 Sabres**

Actually one of the most improved team, would not surprise me if they are 25pts better than last year ... but that's still only 79 points ! 

- **8 Maple Leafs**

Mike Babcock is a great coach, but I don't see what he could do with this roster, maybe they improve some but they will still be bad.

### Metropolitan
- **1 Rangers** (X)

I think they still have a good roster and with Lundqvist they should still be one of the better teams in this division.

- **2 Capitals** (X)

I do like the addition of Oshie and I think they are trending up, especially with Holtby continued progress. They might finish first.

- **3 Blue jackets** (X)

The Blue Jackets will do damage in the East, and adding Saad will help. They where really **really** unlucky last year. I think they will make the playoffs, and if they do they will be very dangerous.

- **4 Islanders** (WC)

The islanders will still be good, similar to last year, I could see them finishing higher, in any case they are a playoff team, at the very least as a wildcard.

- **5 Penguins** (WC)

I'm not a fan of the Penguins, I do like the addition of Bobino. They might score plenty but they will be scored on even more, Not only their defense sucks, but even their forwards mostly aren't strong defensively, I've never been a fan of MAF either. I was going to say no playoffs, but in the "weak" East I guess they should still get a wildcard.

- **6 Hurricanes**

Lack and Versteeg are two strong additions, I think they will be improved but not enough.

- **7 Flyers**

I don't understand the Flyers at all and haven't for years, they'll probably have the usual 80ish points.

- **8 Devils**

They might not be absolutely terrible, thanks to good golatending, but still I can't see them any higher than 6. 

### Central
I would argue that all those teams would finish first or second in the Atlantic.

- **1 Predators** (X)

Continued strong D and goaltending plus scoring by committee. I don't think Forsberg will be as good as last year but this is a solid team.

- **2 Blues** (X)

I see them as a little weaker than last year, but they are still going to be very good in the regular season.

- **3 BlackHawks** (X)

I think the strain of another short summer plus losing a few very good players means sliding a bit in the regular season standings, but they will still be one of the scariest teams in the playoffs.

- **4 Wild** (WC)

I see the wild again as a very good team, but a step bellow the elite teams. They will likely make the playoffs but I'm not sure, for one I can't image Dubnyk match last year. I put them in as a strong wild card.

- **5 Stars** (WC)

A lot of people are bullish on the stars, I'm not sure, kind of like the Penguins (9-7 score when they play?). They will score but questionable D and goaltending, my gut feeling is they will barely edge out the Jets and Flames for the second Wildcard.

- **6 Jets**

I like the Jets and I hope they make the playoffs, but I see them as barely missing out in this crazy strong division, I still don't trust Pavelec much, maybe they pickup Hiller at some point ?

- **7 Avalanche**

They will probably be around 90 points, but in this division I can't see them make the playoffs, in another division they probably would.

### Pacific
- **1 Ducks** (X)

I still can't stand them :) However at this point I can't see anyone in the Pacific beating them in the season standings.

- **2 Sharks** (X)

I really like Martin Jones, a big goalie that make the saves he needs to is something the Sharks have not had in decades. Defense is improved (new players + coaching) and it's quite deeper at forward than last year, 3+ legit lines instead of barely 2. I think the first long summer in a decade will be very good for the veterans such as Marleau who as played more NHL games than anyone his age. On the other hand if Jones turns out to be a dud, they could be in serious trouble.

- **3 Kings** (X)

I think the kings might be back in the playoffs after some rest, but I'm not sure. I think Voynov was greatly underrated and Williams, well Mr Clutch. I don't see them as any better than last year, actually I think they are worse, but they may pass the regressing Canucks and possibly Flames in the standings. I feel like I'm giving them too much credit because of their "history" and they very well might miss the playoffs again. 

- **4 Flames**

On paper the Flames improved, but their numbers last year really didn't add up (poor corsi, crazy OT wins and shot %) and this can't keep up, so I think they will regress a little while others improved. They will fight the Jets and Stars for a wildcard. I could also see the Kings fail, and the Flames get their spot for sure.

- **5 Oilers**
 
Yes the Oilers will improve, probably a lot, but just as the Sabres even a 25 pts gain doesn't even put them close to the playoffs. With McLellan, Talbot and McDavid I think they could reach 80 to 90 points, a great improvement, but no playoffs. 

- **6 Canucks**

I think the Canucks are not going to be very good this year. Yeah the Sedins will still get points. I didn't think they where going to make the playoffs last year and I was wrong, but I see Miller and the twins regressing some and I don't get why they traded Bobino. Maybe they squeak in the playoffs but they definitely aren't winning any playoff series.

- **7 Coyotes**

Auston Matthews almost guaranteed ! Of course there is always the chance the Oilers finish 18th yet win the lottery with 1% odds.
