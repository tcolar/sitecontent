====== About Me ======
Hello there, my name is Thibaut Colar, sarcastic coder, architect & tech lead, in whichever order is needed. 

I grew up in a very tiny village in France but after college I <del>moved</del> **escaped** to The SF bay area(1998) where all the interesting geek stuff was happening, I was in the bubble before and during implosion.

Since 2005 I've lived in the Seattle area with my wife and 2 children.

My interests are software, start-ups, building things, playing and watching hockey.

I am a true End to End dev, I've worked with many of the latest OSS projects as well as massive solutions such as SAP CRM. I love to be the jack of all trades, but I take my trade seriously, I want to craft things that last and scale.

I currently work at a start-up called **[[http://igneous.io/|Igneous Systems]]** in downtown Seattle.

In the past I have worked for [[http://www.qarbon.com|Qarbon.com]], [[http://www.pacificcoast.com|Pacific Coast Feather]], [[http://www.teachscape.com|Teachscape]] and [[Rivet&Sway]]

I also had my own consulting company for a while [[http://www.status302.com | Status302 LLC]]
