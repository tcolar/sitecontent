======Installation of PCF B2B on J2EE 6.40 + IPC3.0 + ISA3.1======

=====2 Hardware Requirements =====

Windows 2003 server, 2GB ram+, 20GB HD +

=====3 Java=====

See Sreenshots for this step: [[Shots B2B Java]]

**3.1 Microsoft VM 5.x** \\
The Microsoft VM is required because the IPC startup scripts (services) have hard link to it, and those services won’t start without it.\\
Install Microsoft java VM (5.0+) / reboot \\
\\Thor.pcf.com\is\SAPDownloads\ISA640\ msjavx86.exe

**3.2 Java 1.3** \\
Install jdk 1.3.1_16(This will be use by the IPC only)\\
\\Thor.pcf.com\is\SAPDownloads\j2sdk-1_3_1_16-windows-i586.exe\\
Note: install in c:\jdk1.3…… (Default)\\

**3.3 Java 1.4** \\
Install jdk1.4.2_09  (this will be the default java env)\\
\\Thor.pcf.com\is\SAPDownloads\j2sdk-1_4_2_09-windows-i586-p.exe\\
Note install in c:\jdk1.4…..(Default)

Set JAVA_HOME to java 1.4

ADD java1.4\bin to PATH 

Note: On windows 2003, after the first reboot, windows shut down javaw as a security treat !! (Don’t get me started :-) ) \\
Anyway, **disable “DEP”** so it won’t block java from running anymore and reboot.

=====4 Install the IPC Webshops=====

Copy “Shops” folder.  (Note: make sure “PricingProcedure” is set to 1 in xml files)\\
Copy the folder \\Thor.pcf.com\is\SAPDownloads\ISA640\Shops onto C:\  (to have c:\shops)\\
Note: **SHOPS on Thor might not be up to date**, get the latest from wherever it is (ie: production)

=====5 Install JCO=====  

See Sreenshots for this step: [[Shots B2B JCO]]

Extract JCO 2.0 from \\
\\Thor.pcf.com\is\SAPDownloads\JCOx\2_0_10\sapjco-ntintel-2.0.10.zip \\
into c:\usr\sap\jco (create the folder)

Add the JCO jar (sapjco.jar) to the classpath
 
Add the JCO folder to the path
 
Copy librfc32.dll from the JCO folder into c:\winnt\system32 (replace **ONLY** if newer).

Note : **Had to add sapjco.jar to the sap "system" library folder as well** \\ c:\usr\sap\J2E\jcoo\j2ee\cluster\server0\bin\system, otherwise the j2ee server cannot find it.  Do this after installing the central instance and patches

=====6 Oracle=====
**6.1 Installing Oracle** \\  

See Sreenshots for this step: [[Shots B2B OraInst]]

Start the Oracle installer:\\
Z:\SAPDownloads\CD51030122\ORA92_1\NT\I386\**sapserver.cmd  (NOT SETUP.exe)** \\
**Install in the folder (c:\oracle\Z03\920_32) -> NON DEFAULT** \\
Where Z03 will be the SAP J2EE instance number, 920 is the oracle version and 32 stands for 32 bits.

Choose NO to “create a database”
 
Start the installation, when it asks for CD2, CD3 just browse to it (on Thor):\\
When the network configurator start just choose “typical configuration ”

**6.2 Installing the Oracle patch (9.2 patch 7)** \\  

See Sreenshots for this step: [[Shots B2B OraPatch]]

Unzip the patch from: \\
\\Thor.pcf.com\is\SAPDownloads\Oracle patches\9.2.0.7 win32\P4163445_92070_WINNT.ZIP \\
in a local folder (ie: c:\ora_patches\)

First you need to shutdown the Oracle services before applying the patch

Start the setup.exe (might have to start it from the command line – had to once)

Make sure you give it the correct oracle path

Reboot or at least restart the oracle services you stopped.

Note: Had to change OracleTSNListener service to "automatic" rather than manual (should be by default, but once it did not)

=====7 SAP Central Instance for Oracle (WebAS, etc …)=====

**7.1 Install the central instance** \\  

See Sreenshots for this step: [[Shots B2B Central Inst]]

Start the installer from:\\
\\thor\SAPDownloads\D51031148\IM01_NT_I386\SAPINST\NT\I386\sapinst.exe \\
Choose the Sap NW/Java system/Oracle/Central system/default installation

The installer will log you off and back on, this is normal.\\
Then it will ask for the java DVD, either use the actual DVD, or browse to it on Thor (it will need to be mapped as a network drive)\\
Ie: \\Z:\IS\SAPDownloads\D51030724

Keep the default settings, however instance name and database SID have to be changed and be unique (here we use Z03)
 
Set the master password, do not forget this password, it will be both the DB, java etc… password.

Installation will start running, this takes a looooong time, go take a break  (2h+)

Note: “Start SAP j2EE engine” takes about 40mn, this is normal, all the java app are being compiled.

Note: It is useful to create shortcuts on the desktop to the admin tool, deploy tool and log viewer

Note: If you get an IGS server error: (should not)\\
Setup the IGS (image server that create graphs): \\
go into c:\usr\sap\j2ee\jc00\igs\conf and:\\
- copy gfwchart.tpl into gfwchart\\
- copy xmlchart.tpl into xmlchart\\
(igs http status on port 40080)\\

**7.2 Installing the SAP Central Instance Patches** \\  

See Sreenshots for this step: [[Shots B2B Central Patch]]

The patches are in: \\Thor.pcf.com\is\SAPDownloads\J2EE\j2eepatch14
Copy them locally.
Note: list of patch files (in order)\\
-SAPINST14_0-20000118.SAR\\
-CTRLORA14_0-20000118.SAR\\
-J2EERT14_0-10001982.SAR\\
-J2EERTOS14_0-20000118.SAR\\
-IGS_11-10002111.SAR

Use Sapcar.exe to extract all those SAR files **in THAT order** \\
(sapcar –xvf  ….) \\
Then go into SAPINST-CD\SAPINST\NT\I386 and run sapinst.exe\\ 
Do “import support package”.\\
It will ask to select the instance profile.\\
Browse to c:\usr\sap\Z03\SYS\profile and select Z03_JC00_[hostname]

On the next screen it will ask you the passwords, enter the Master password defined during the install in both field.

Note: it might give a warning that the swap size is to small, ignore it.

Upgrade will run, take another break :-)

Copy the sapjco.jar as explained at the end of Step 5.

**When upgrading to SP14 using Oracle 9.2.0.7 there is a problem and the j2ee engine don’t get patched correctly while other components do**.\\
See note #884678\\
Here is what to do:\\
Stop the sdm by running\\
<code>
c:\usr\sap\Z03\JC00\SDM\program\stopserver.bat
</code>
Go to c:\usr\sap\Z03\JC00\SDM\program\lib\util\slutil \\
And rename slutil.jar into slutil_old\\
Then copy the new one in place\\
\\Thor.pcf.com\is\SAPDownloads\ISA640\sp14_fix\slutil.jar \\
Go to c:\usr\sap\Z03\JC00\SDM\program\lib\ \\
And rename slutilapi.jar into slutilapi_old \\
RUN: 
<code>sdm.bat systemcomponentstate “mode=sync”</code>
Restart the SDM \\
<code>c:\usr\sap\Z03\JC00\SDM\program\startserver.bat</code>
Start the SDM tool \\
<code>c:\usr\sap\Z03\JC00\SDM\program\remotegui.bat</code>
press the connect button and enter the password to connect to the local machine\\
Go to the deployement Tab and press the “+” icon.\\
And browse to the 
\\Thor.pcf.com\is\SAPDownloads\ISA640\sp14_fix\slutil.sda \\
And press “next” twice and then “start deployment” and complete the deployment, then close the SDMtool.\\
Then restart the J2EE engine with the MMC.

=====8 Prepare the IPC tables in the Oracle Database=====

**8.1.1 Creating the database** \\  

See Sreenshots for this step: [[Shots B2B IPC DB]]

Full guide is in 
\\Thor.pcf.com\is\SAP_docs\IPC\IPC40_Sr_V216.pdf (step 6.3.4.213) \\
Here is the short version:

Start the Oracle configuration assistant (start menu)\\
Choose “create new database”\\
Choose “Transaction processing”\\
Enter “IPC” for the database name\\
Choose “dedicated Server mode”\\
Choose “Unicode” for the db character set\\
Choose “UTF8” for the national set\\
Press “Finish” to create the database.\\

At the end of the DB creation it will ask for password, use the same as the master password for simplicity. Then press exit.

**8.1.2Creating Table space and User** \\  

See Sreenshots for this step: [[Shots B2B IpC Tables]]

Start the oracle Enterprise Manager console (in start/programs/oracle menu)\\
Choose “launch standalone”\\
Click navigator / add database to tree\\
Enter the database info:\\
-hostname: The machine hostname or ‘localhost’\\
-Port: enter ‘1521’ (Or could be 1527)\\
-ID: enter the database SID (in this example we used “IPC”)\\

The DB will appear in the tree, click on it to connect to it.\\
The login panel will appear. Enter “system” as the username. Enter the master password in the password field, leave “connect as” on “normal”.
 
Open the Storage branch\\
Right click on “Tablespace” and choose Create\\
Enter “IPC” for the name\\
Leave the size to “5MB”\\
Click the “pen icon” (edit data file)\\
Leave file size on 5MB\\
In the storage tab: choose “automatically extend” and choose increment=”1MB”\\
Click “Create”\\
The tablespace is created.\\

Now, create the IPC user:\\
Open the security section\\
Right click on “user”\\
Choose “create”
 

For the user name enter “IPC”\\
Choose a password (ie: “ipc”)\\
Choose “IPC” as the default tablespace\\
Go to the “Role” tab\\
Double click “DBA” to add it to the roles\\
Press “Create”
 

Done.

**8.2 Install the IPC server** \\ 

See Sreenshots for this step: [[Shots B2B IPC Install]]

For ISA 3.1Patch6, the IPC MUST be 30sp16 (according to SAP note).\\
Download the IPC installer from here 
\\Thor.pcf.com\is\SAPDownloads\ISA640\ipc30sp16
(both files) into the a local folder.\\
Also copy \\Thor.pcf.com\is\SAPDownloads\sapcar.exe in the same folder.

Open a command shell and go inside the folder and run:\\
Sapcar.exe –xvf  SAPINST_1-10001213.SAR\\
Sapcar.exe –xvf  IPC30SP16_1-10001213.SAR

This will have extracted the installer.\\
Go in the  SAPINST\NT\I386 folder and run SAPInst.cmd

The installer will ask where the files are please browse to CRMIPC30

On the next screen you need to change both Paths:\\
-Change the installation path to c:\usr\sap\\
-Change The java path to the java1.3 path (**important**)

On the next screen, choose to install IPC, cat is not necessary but leave on anyway.

Installation will run and complete.

-set IPC services to “Automatic”  (by default they are set to manual), the dispatcher and server services. Dataloader should stay on “manual”

Edit the bat files of IPC, and add JAVA_HOME=c:\jdk1.3.1_16 at the top of each (especially dataloader.bat) so that it will run on 1.3 as recommended.

**8.3 Configuring the IPC and initial download** \ 

See Sreenshots for this step: [[Shots B2B IPC Config]]

**Copy classes12.zip from C:\oracle\Z01\920_32\jdbc\lib into C:\usr\sap\ipc\lib**
This is the Oracle driver, IPC won’t work without it !!

Start the IPC administrator (from the start menu).\\
Go to the “server” tab\\
Verify the settings, no changes are necessary, but you might want to set the password, and set the log files to c:\usr\sap\ipc\ .... .log rather than “my documents”.
 

Go to the “Database” tab.\\
Click “add”.\\
Select “R/3 system”.\\
Enter the r/3 server name (ie:“Cujo”) as the alias\\
Uncheck the “load balanced” box.\\
Enter the application server name (cujo.pcf.com)\\
Enter the system Number (05)\\
Enter the IPC user name (ipclogin)\
Enter the IPC password (*****) ask Thibaut or Lisa for it.\\
Enter “001” for the client Number.
 

Once it’s added, press OK to close the db info panel.\\
Note: Back on the main panel, click on the added R/3 server and click “Login” to check it works.\\
Now we need to add the local database (Oracle)\\
Press “Add” again\\
Select “database”\\
Enter “Oracle” for the alias\\
Enter “Localhost” for the server\\
Choose “Oracle” as the system\\
Enter the database name (IPC)\\
Enter the db port (1521 or 1527)\\
Enter the db user name (ipc)\\
Enter the db user password (ipc)\\
Enter “001” as the client\\
Press “ok” to create it\\

Press “Save” to save all those settings.

Select “Oracle” to select the database.\\
Then click “**Create Tables**” to initialize the IPC tables.

You should then get a message that the tables where created successfully.
 

Click “Ok”
Click “Login” to login into the Oracle database.

Click on “Pricing engine parameters”\\
Click “default” to auto fill the parameters\\
Click “transaction tax engine”\\
Uncheck “TTE Enabled” otherwise there will be errors and warning later.
 

Press “Save” and then exit the administrator.


**Copy the materials and conditions from Thor**\\ \\thor.pcf.com\IS\SAPDownloads\ISA640\conditions or production (latest) into c:\usr\sap\ipc\lib\properties 

Start the dataloader from the c:\usr\sap\ipc\bin\
 

Click “Add”
Choose source database “cujo” , client “001”, target db “oracle” target client “001”, **RFC destination “IPC”**.
 

Click “Details” next to product data\\
Select user-defined and browse to c:\usr\sap\ipc\lib\properties\materials.txt
 

Click “Details” next to condition records\\
Select user-defined and browse to c:\usr\sap\ipc\lib\properties\conditions.txt
 

Press “Ok”

Then click “Start initial” to load the IPC data (this takes 10mn or so).

Once it completed, exit the dataloader.

Start the “IPC Administrator” once again.\\
Go to the “database” section\\
Click on “cujo”\\
Then click on “Login”\\
Click on “oracle”\\
Then click on “Login”\\
Click on “Pricing Engine Conf”\\
Then click on “document parameters”\\
Choose the pricing procedure “PCFB2B”\\
Choose “USD” for the currencies\\
Language “EN”, country “US”\\
Then press “Save”
 

Then go to “Document header Attributes”\\
Set BURKS to PCU1\\
Set VKORG to US01

Save and exit the Administrator tool

Note: It’s possible to test the IPC conditions got loaded correctly in the database with a query like this: “select * from ipc.cncv_a_SAP032 where MATNR=925” in Oracle.

**Reboot to get IPC etc… restarted.**

=====9 Post install Steps=====

See Sreenshots for this step: [[Shots B2B Post-Install]]

Had to add jarm.jar (recent version \\thor.pcf.com\IS\SAPDownloads\ISA640\jarm.jar ) into c:\usr\sap\J2E\jcoo\j2ee\cluster\server0\bin\system, ISA uses that jar, however it as been removed/obsolete in J2EE 6.40 (was provided with 6.20)

Restart the J2ee engine or reboot after installing this

License:\\
Start the Visual Administrator and login to the default (localhost)\\
Go to server/services/Licensing adapter\\
Copy the system Id and hardware key, then go to http://service.sap.com/licensing or ask Bob to get the license key.\\
Once you get the license file fromSAP, save it locally into c:\usr\sap\Z03\license.txt.\\
Then go back into “licensing adapter” and do “install license from file”, browse to the license file.

Java crypto setup (required for SSL etc …)

AIK SSL or turn off secure thingy -> note 796540 ….\\
See also \\
http://help.sap.com/saphelp_nw04s/helpdata/en/f1/2de3be0382df45a398d3f9fb86a36a/frameset.htm \\
(which does it using the SDA) And \\
https://websmp201.sap-ag.de/~form/sapnet?_FRAME=CONTAINER&_OBJECT=012006153200000280532003

Get the crypto library CAR from\\
\\thor\IS\SAPDownloads\Java Cryptolib ssl \\
Extract the CAR file using sapcar.exe –xvf \\
Copy all the jar files into C:\usr\sap\Z03\SYS\global\security\lib\engine \\

**DELETE the old iaik_jce_export.jar** \\
in the same folder or **it won’t work**  \\

Not sure if this is required or not: \\
-- \\
Download the JCE unlimited strength policy files from sun\\
Copy from \\thor\IS\SAPDownloads\Java Cryptolib ssl\jce_policy-1.5.0.zip\\
And extract it.\\
Then copy the jar files into [JAVA_HOME]\lib\security\\
--

**Remove C:\j2sdk1.4.2_09\jre\lib\jce.jar (or rename jce.back) or it will not work**\\
because it conflicts with IAIK. \\

Go in the config tool,  and set startup mode to ALWAYS for dispatcher/SSL and save.

Note: The provided SSL certificates are expired, to use SSl successfully, we need to create new ones.\\
See separate doc here:\\
\\thor.pcf.com\IS\SAPDownloads\ISA640\doc\upgradingsslkeys.doc \\

Restart the J2EE engine
