======Beautiful fonts in Java======

When working in an IDE, we are starring all day at pretty small fonts and nowadays with LCD's extra sharpness sometimes you start seeing the jaggies(pixel edges) too much.

Nowadays java support not only font anti-aliasing but also sub pixel rendering. That's a fancy anti-aliasing where the subpixels(red, green, blue) are set separately for an even smoother looking font.

You can enable this by setting this variable:

''_JAVA_OPTIONS="-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on"''

You could export that manually or maybe set it in /etc/environment (global vars)

Or say you want that just in Netbeans, you would edit netbeans/etc/netbeans.conf:
and add that too the java options, for example:


<code | netbeans/etc/netbeans.conf>
netbeans_default_options="-J-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd -J-client -J-Xss2m -J-Xms32m -J-XX:PermSize=32m -J-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true -J-Dapple.awt.graphics.UseQuartz=true -J-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true -J-Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=true"
</code>

TIP: While you are at it you might want to set a better font than the standard one, for example I like ''DejaVu Sans Mono'' but there are other good ones.
