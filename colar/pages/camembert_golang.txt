======Camembert IDE Go / Golang support======

I have added more and more language support to [[status302:Camembert]] to the point that now I use to edit and work
on just about all projects (Fantom, Go, Python, Ruby etc...).

Lately I've done quite a bit of code in GO at [[Rivet and Sway]] lately, so I've beefed up a bit the Go support in Camembert.

Here are some of the current features:
  - Syntax highlighting.
  - Build/Test/Run commands.
  - Integrated documentation pane with search (godoc).
  - Run/build output goes to console and error can be cliked to go directly to source location.
  - Navigation panel: Shows structs, functions and vars with "hot links".
  - GoFmt support can be called manually or automatically when .go files are saved.
  - and probably more stuff I'm not thinking about right now ...
