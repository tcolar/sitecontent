====== Camping Trailer ======
I had plans to make my own trailer (teardrop), using plans like [[http://www.angib.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/teardrop/tear00.htmi|those]] and ideas of my own.
However i never got to it, so now i might buy one.

WARNING: **Update 07/2010 - I've now decided to build my own, started 07/2010, see here for how I build it:

=====Lightweight trailers Listings (2008/2010)=====
Listed here are a lot of compact trailers, not every single one of them but most.
I didn't put some of the most obscure/custom ones, unless there was at least some informative site.
**What are listed here are only lightweight trailers (<2000 pounds)** which can be towed by "regular" cars / minivans.

Tip: RV dealers are usually not carrying/not interested in selling you those low-margin vehicles and rather spend there time trying to sell you so huge RV, so often time you should / have to buy direct from the manufacturer, or try to find a RV stores that specializes into small trailers.

For a couple i recommand a teardrop, is cool and fuel-efficeint, if you have kids then a popu is probably the best. If you live camping in adverse weather, then an "shell"/fiberglass is probably the best.

If you are looking for a camper to go alone in the winter (ie: hunting), you might like the A-Frames.

====Teardrop trailers====
Those are very small cool-looking "water drop" shape trailers, tipically between 400 and 1500 pounds usually only sleeps 1 or 2, though a few can also sleep 1 or 2 childs as well.
Thi is usally just a bed and some storage, no living quarters usually.
Typically 5000-10000$

====Popup trailers====
Those are folding trailers, that expand a lot with canvas extensions, they can sleep a lot of people and are spacious and full of amenities for their weight.
On the other hand they are less sturdy and won't keep you cold/warm or keep a bear out :-)
Also you have to work a little to open/close it and possibly deal with wet canvas etc...
Typically 5000-14000 $

====Lightweight "shell" trailers====
Those are "regular" trailers, thought smaller, lighter version, they provide living quarters though less than a popup, on the other hand they hard sturdier, hard shell, and well insulated and requires no setup whatsoever. Usually made of a fiberglass shell.
They are more expensive than trailers and popups, since there is more "material".
Typically 8000-16000 $

====A-Frame trailers====
A-Frames are folding trailer than open into an A-frame (like a little house), they are not as roomy and tend to be expensive.
What they have for them are great insulation and strength and sturdiness, they are probably best for going hunting in the wild etc...
Typically 12000+ $
