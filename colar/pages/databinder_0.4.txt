====== DataBinder 0.4 install ======

After getting wicket1.2 and databinder 0.4 [[http://technically.us/n8/ | here]]\\
extract both files, and in each folder (wicket & databinder) run ''mvn install''


Then go in your project folder and edit pom.xml\\
replace the databinder dependency from 0.3 to 0.4\\

That should be all that is needed.

Might want to read the [[http://wicket-wiki.org.uk/wiki/index.php/Migrate-1.2 | wicket 1.2 migration guide]]
