======Duplicating a CD on linux (Including VCD)======

This can be done easily using the "disc at once" tool, that smartly copy the whole disc as once instead of stupidly tryign to get separate files.
You need the cdrdao tool installed.
First you need to find your device, use:
cdrdao scanbus
If it finds nothing, then you probably have an ATA drive (ie: IDE, not sccsi), in that case you can find it with the cdrecord tool:
<code bash>
cdrecord -scanbus dev=ATA
</code>
It should return something like:

<code>

</code>
From that you see the (sony) cdrom drive device is "0,1,0"

So now we know that we can make the actual copy, first pop the disk to be copied into the drive, then run: (if you use a scsi drive, remove "ATA:")
<code bash>
cdrdao read-cd --device ATA:0,1,0 --driver generic-mmc cd.toc
</code>
That will read the CD.
If you are copying an audio CD, you can also try retrieveing the CDDB data (songs titles), etc by running:
<code bash>
cdrdao read-cddb --device ATA:0,1,0 --driver generic-mmc cd.toc
</code>
Now, put a blank CD in the drive and run this command to write the CD:
<code bash>
cdrdao write --device ATA:0,1,0 --driver generic-mmc cd.toc
</code>
