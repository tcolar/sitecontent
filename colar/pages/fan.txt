======Fantom======
**[[http://fantom.org | Fantom]] is an exciting new language that targets the Java VM and the CLR**.
It borrows it's Syntax from Java but also adds many features and syntactic sugar created or borrowed from .NET, Groovy, Python, Erlang etc...

It's immediately familiar to a Java / .Net programmer but is much less painful to use (**no boilerplate**).
