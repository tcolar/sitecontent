======Fetching source code from GitHub from behind a firewall======
  - Usually you would fetch code from github like this:
**Note**: Of course replace 'user' and 'project' by actual user and project names.

''git clone git://github.com/user/project.git''

However Behind a firewall that might not work (port  9418)

  - **In theory you can do a clone over http like**:

''git clone http://github.com/user/project.git''

However that seem to fail half way through most of the times.

  - **If you just want a snapshot of the latest code (don't need to commit), I've found this trick**:

''curl -L http://github.com/user/project/tarball/master -o project.tar.gz''

I think you can also replace "master" by tags/commit numbers as well to get a specific version.

  - If you need a real clone to do commits etc, then you will need to use an SSH tunnel, see:
