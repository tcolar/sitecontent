====== Basic setup to get started with JSP development ======

===== Install Eclipse =====
Get eclipse here:\\
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.1.2-200601181600/eclipse-SDK-3.1.2-win32.zip

and install (unzip) it in c:\eclipse

===== Install Tomcat =====
Get tomcat here:\\
http://apache.tradebit.com/pub/tomcat/tomcat-5/v5.0.28/bin/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28.exe

Run the installer, and install tomcat in c:\tomcat

===== Install a tomcat plugin for eclipse =====

We use the sysdeo plugin, there are many others

Go to http://www.sysdeo.com/eclipse/tomcatplugin \\
Download http://www.sysdeo.com/sysdeo/content/download/393/4930/file/tomcatPluginV31.zip \\
Unzip It inside c:/eclipse/plugins/

===== Configuring the plugin =====
Start eclipse\\
go in window/customize perspective/commands   and check (enable)  "Tomcat"

in eclipse go in window/preferences/tomcat
Choose your version of tomcat (ie: 5.x)
And set "Tomcat home" to where you installed tomcat (ie: c:\tomcat)

===== Creating a web project =====
Go to file/new/project  then  select java/tomcat project, define a oproject name (ie: test)

===== Testing a project =====
Now you should see the project in "package explorer"\\
expand it

Go to file/new/project  then  select java/tomcat project, define a oproject name (ie: test)

Now you should see the project in "package explorer"\\
expand it

Right click on th project and select new/other/web/JSP,  choose a name (ie: index.jsp)
The index.jsp will open in eclipse

Modify it, for example add a line inside body as such:
<code>
The Current time is <%=new java.util.Date() %>
</code>
Save the file

Click on the "start tomcat" icon in the eclipse menubar, so that it picks up this new project

Go see the results at http://127.0.0.1:8080/test/

Make some other changes to the JSP, see the results right away by refreshing the browser page.

Get a book and start testing the examples and playing with it.
