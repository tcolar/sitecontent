======GP2X Software======
On June 14 2008, i ordered a [[http://www.gp2x.com|GP2X-F200]] which is a really nice Linux based portable video console.
Think of it as a hacker PSP.

Anyway it's great i can play games like Doom etc.. on the go,

One of the lame things is that it has a touchscreen built-in yet, almost no support for it exist at this time, so i got coding almost right away.

=====Stylus2X=====
I created a project called [[Stylus2x]]

The aim of this project is to provide some applications with built-in keyboard support (virtual onscreen keyboard).
