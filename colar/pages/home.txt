Hello there, my name is **Thibaut Colar**.

I'm a sarcastic coder, architect & tech lead, in whichever order is needed. 

My interests are software, start-ups, building things, playing and watching hockey and good food.

I currently work at Glympse where I'm replatforming a high volume .NET monolith to a fleet of Go microservices. 
Go has been my primary language for over 4 years and I love it.

Here you will find:
  * [[My Blog]]
  Where I talk about many things, mostly related to **software development** and the **start-up** life.

  * [[My Software]]
  Find out about all the **open-source software I've written** and links to my code repos.

  * [[My Projects]]
  The things I've built over the years, such as a **camping trailer, an arcade, a standing desk** and more.

  * [[About me]]
  Here you will find more info about me and my family, as well as my **contact info and resume**.
