Setting this up was quite a pain.


===== RFC connections =====
Use SM59 to check the RFC's SAPFTP,SAPFTPA,SAPHTTP and SAPHTTPA\\
This transactions are suppose to work out of the box, but we had problems with them.

See notes: 164203, 455197, 544843

The main issue i had was that SAPHTTP was broken out of the box.\\
By running RSHTTP05 (under SE38), it reported the transaction SAPHTTP was broken. So i had to go to SM59 and delete it.\\
Then run RSHTTP05 again, it will recreate it correctly and the test should work.

===== Configuring the web/ftp server (FTP + WebDav)=====

We use apache / Pure-Ftpd

Apache config:  add webdav section / restart apache
<code>
ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www
        DavLockDB /var/lock/apache2/FTP-DAVLock
        <Directory /var/www/crmdev>
                DAV On
                AuthType Basic
                AuthName "Image server"
                AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/davusers
                <LimitExcept GET HEAD OPTIONS>
                Require user image
                </LimitExcept>
        </Directory>
</code>

Pure-ftpd:
<code>
pure-pw useradd image -f pureftpd.passwd -u 1001 -g 1001 -d /var/www/
pure-pw mkdb
</code>

Note: Webdav/apache and Pure-Ftpd HAVE to point to the same directory.

To help finding issues:
<code>
tail /var/log/pure-ftpd/transfer.log /var/log/apache2/*.log /var/log/messages -f
</code>

===== Configuring the RFC =====
Go to transaction SPRO, and see "Define search server relation".

{{ trex_img.jpg }} 

Also check the RFC was created correctly:

{{ sm59.jpg }} 

===== Define the publishing target =====
Go to transaction SPRO  and run **"Set Targets for publishing catalog contents"** \\

WARNING: Also new in 2007(not on the screenshot) : go to **"Maintain IMS server for Catalog Indexing"** (same folder) and enter the RFC in there (ex: "**TREX_RFC_TRX**")
