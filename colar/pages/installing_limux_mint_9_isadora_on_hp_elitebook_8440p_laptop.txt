======Installing Linux Mint 9 (Isadora) on HP EliteBook 8440P laptop======

[[http://www.linuxmint.com/|Linux Mint]] is a nice distro based on Ubuntu, it's very polished and has some nice easy to use features, and comes with all the codecs/plugins you need out of the box.
I've used it since version 5 on my laptop.

Version 9 (Isadora) is based on Ubuntu Lucid.

I work I got a new HP EliteBook 8440P and there where a few gotchas to get Mint(or any Linux) on it, mostly issues with the newer NVidia graphic card support.

===Booting the LiveCD/Installer===
Right off the bat, problem.
**With the graphic card issue it would just display fuzzy pixels and be unusable (can't install)**

So step 1:
**When Booting the CD**, in the boot menu:
  - **highlight** "start linux mint"
  - press **tab** to edit the boot line
  - **replace** ''quiet splash --'' with ''nosplash nomodeset'' and press enter

This will allow to boot in a graphic mode that works (although less cute)

===Installing mint===
Once you have the Mint LiveCD booted up, click the **"install mint"** desktop shortcut and install 
... Nothing special here ...
end of install, **shutdown**, **remove disk** and press enter to **reboot**

===First boot from Hard drive===
More shenanigans for the video issue(now grub):
  - **highlight** "linux mint 9"
  - **press "e"** to edit boot command
  - on the line that starts  with "linux ..." go to the end and **replace** "quiet splash" with "nosplash nomodeset"
Then **press CONTROL and X** to boot mint

===Fixing the Video problem forever in grub===
We don't want to edit the boot command at each start :)
  - **Start a terminal** : Click Menu/terminal

  - **execute**: ''sudo gedit /etc/default/grub''

  - **change** ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT per-- GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quet splash"''
to:
  - ''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT per-- GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="nosplash nomodeset"''
  - then **save and close** gedit

===NVidia Video driver===
**Configure your network/wifi** (click the "network" icon in task bar) as it will be needed

**Click the "hardware drivers" icon** (looks like a PCI card, next to volume control in right of task bar) and select **"install drivers"**
**Activate the nvidia driver**.
It will download & install the nvidia graphic card driver

===Making the brightness controls work===
Still in terminal 
**execute** ''sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf''

In "Device" section **add this line**: (before EndSection)

''Option "RegistryDwords" "EnableBrightnessControl=1"''

**Save and close** gedit

**Execute**: ''sudo gedit /usr/share/hal/fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-laptop-panel-hardware.fdi''

**Add '84440p'** to line 27, like this:

''<match key="/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer:system.hardware.product" contains_outof="4410s;4415s;4416s;Compaq 5X5;8440p">''

===Software Updates===
It's a good time to install the software updates as well 
**Run "mint updates"** - shield icon in tak bar and install all available updates

===REBOOT===
**REBOOT & Enjoy !**
