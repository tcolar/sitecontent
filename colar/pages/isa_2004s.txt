===== Suse Upgrade Notes =====

After installing suse from DVD's, upgrade/patch it.\\

To upgrade suse: go in Yast2, then "online update"\\
use the "ireland" server as it's faster\\

WARNING: YOU MUST CLICK "RELOAD ALL PATCHES FROM SERVER" to get the new patches and also check "manually choose patches"


WARNING: Update only the kernel first (to over 2.6.5.7-139)


Then reboot and come back in yast2 to upgrade everything else (except nvidia and auto4fs and mksdkprod.sh : skip those since they fail anyhow and they are only optional)\\

NOTE Copy the Suse cds(usually only CD1 and CD2 needed) on the hard drive (ie: from b2btst /root/suse_cds and set them up in yast as the sources of install, that way we can install missing software without having to insert the cd's.

=====Installing the SAP stuffs=====

NOTE Might have to install sambaclient with yast2 first.\\
mount the sapcd folder for easy access to needed software \\

<code>
mkdir /mnt/sapcd
smbmount //frenchie/sapcd /mnt/sapcd/ (no password)
</code>

Note, you might need to install samba-client wth yast2 to get smbmount.\\

WARNING **DO NOT Installed Java from suse** (if installed, remove it with YAST)\\

Install the special IBM SAP jvm from \\
[[https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=javasap]] \\
(need to login with my home email and usual pass, get the one for AMD64)
(avail also on thor is/sap-downloads/IBM-jvm and /mnt/sapcd/ibm-jvms once mounted) \\

<code>
rpm -Uvh  rpm -Uvh /mnt/sapcd/java_installers/IBM-jvm/IBMJava2-AMD64-142-SDK-1.4.2-7.0.x86_64.rpm
copy the ibm conf file (made by thib)
cp /mnt/sapcd/java_installers/IBM-jvm/IBMJava2.conf /etc/java
</code>

and then run ''SetDefaultJava'' to get java linked\\

Then run 
<code>source setJava Java2</code>
to get java setup and added to your env right away. (NOTE do this in ALL open shells)\\

(verify java is installed ''java -version'' shoudl work)\\

=====Pre-Install=====

Start the SAP Installer

''cd /mnt/sapcd/51031407_crm50_nw2004s_master/IM_LINUX_X86_64''\\
Ran sapinst (''./sapinst'')\\

Run the prerequities checks <sap system>-Lifecycle-preparation-prerequities/check\\
(central service instance - java)\\
Several issues: (All covered in the suse note(s))\\

====Issue 1====
install sapinit see note #171356 and #797084

Note: it was already installed, however sapinst thought it was'nt (maybe it was a too old or unsupported version)

So deinstall (invalid)sapinit package in yast2 then reinstall using the following rpm \\

delete sapinit package in yast2 then reinstall using the downloaded rpm \\
from http://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/sap/SLES9/x86-64/packages/ (also in /mnt/sapcd/sap_suse_addons)

rpm -ivh suse-xxxxx
it came with Suse SP3, yet the cd sapinst would complain it's not there anyhow\\

Note: it requires compat and sysstat, install with yast2 if they are missing.\\

Once installed, run ''/etc/init.d/sapr3 start'' (as root)\\

====Issue 2====

Sap locales (same note #171356): 

From the note download the attachment\\

https://websmp201.sap-ag.de/~sapidb/012006153200000442092005E/saplocales_sles9_x86_64_version-7.zip 

It is saved on /mnt/sapcd/sap_suse_addons

unzip it\\

install the extracted rpm:

''rpm -ivh saplocales-xxx.rpm''

WARNING this need to be reinstalled every time the kernel or glibc are modified (upgrade) !!!

====Soft hard resources limits (Note #797084)====

Number of "file descriptors"\\
Edit: /etc/security/limits.conf\\
and add the following lines to it:
<code>
* hard nofile 4096
* soft nofile 4096
</code>

These changes take effect after you log off and log back on again (thib: just source /etc/profile)

#edit /usr/lib/java/jre/lib/security/java.security and replace /dev/random by /dev/urandom if present

After changing all this, it's recommanded to reboot (to force reload of the shm etc.. settings)

=====Install=====

Connect to the machine with an X session (Window manager recommanded or it doesn't refresh right)\\
Go back in /mnt/sapcd/51031407_crm50_nw2004s_master/IM_LINUX_X86_64\\

Run sapinst and install netweaver2004s/systems with usage types/oracle/central system/central system install.\\

  * Type of install "AS-Java"\\

When it asks for the java dvd, browse to: /mnt/sapcd/51031372_nw2004s_javacomponents\\
When it asks for the java crypto files, browse to:\\

(https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=jcesdk)\\

/mnt/sapcd/Java Cryptolib ssl/ibmjce1.4.2.zip\\

  * System ID: ie: T2C\\
  * DB ID: ie: T2C\\

Enter password/login for sapmaster(*) and oracle (*)\\
Keep the default memory setting if it seem ok (in this case was 2GB out of 4GB)\\

  * java schema password: *\\
When it asks for the oracle dvd, browse to: /mnt/sapcd/51031244_oracle10.1_linux64\\

  * Secure store settings / keyphrase: *\\

  * SCS instance: 00 (default)\\

  * CI instance: 01 (default)\\

  * For UME: use java database\\
  * Admin/SDM password: *\\

Then it will ask for the kernel 7 dvd: /mnt/sapcd/51031391_2004s_kernel7_lin_win\\
And also the Oracle client CD: /mnt/sapcd/51031518_oracle_client10.2\\

  * Register into the SLD: jdiprod.pcf.com 50000 / administrator / 123...\\

ADS admin password .. same as admin password\\

Installation will start .....\\
After step 8 if will ask to do the oracle setup\\


====Oracle setup====

Note: There are permissions problems, so first we need to run as root (as explained in the pdf):\\

<code>
chown orat2c /oracle
chgrp dba /oracle
chmod 775 /oracle
</code>

log as orat2c and export the display (not bash but csh) to your X\\
verify than umask  value is 22 (if not it need to be set to 22, see doc)\\
<code>
su - orat2c
setenv DISPLAY 10.10.1.194:0
umask
cd /oracle/stage/101_64/db/Disk1/SAP/ # (NOT /mnt/sapcd ... BUT The one is THE SAP folder ! )\\
./RUNINSTALLER
</code>

Then it will ask to run ''/oracle/orainventory/oraInstRoot.sh'', do so in another shell as root ... then press continue\\

File locations default should be good\\
Component selection should be left alone\\

WARNING: I would get this error: Error in invoking target ntcontab.o of makefile ...
GCC was missing, had to install it with yast.


Oracle install will run then it will ask to run another script as root:\\ ''/oracle/T2C/101_64/root.sh'' .. do it on the root shell\\

It will install binaries etc ... in /usr/bin and start the DB\\
Go back to the oracle installer GUI and click OK\\
Cancel the network configuration assistant, then exit the oracle installer.\\

WARNING: **DO NOT CONTINUE THE SAP INSTALLATION YET ! We need t install oracle patches first**

Now we need to install the latest Oracle patches (10.1.0.4)\\

Downloaded form 'sap market place' and copied into /mnt/sapcd/Oracle_patches/10.1.0.4_linux64\\

<code>
#Reattach the patch pieces together (note: 509314)\\
#cat PSET_10104_LINUX-X86-64AA.BIN Pset_10104_Linux-x86-64ab.bin Pset_10104_Linux-x86-64ac.bin >> PSET_10104_LINUX-X86-64.zip
#unzip this new zip
#unzip PSETxxxxxx.zip
</code>

Install the patchset\\
#do this as orat2c:\\
<code>
su - orat2c
cd /mnt/sapcd/Oracle_patches/10.1.0.4_linux64/PSET_10104_LINUX-X86-64/Disk1
</code>

As root: stop cssd: ''/etc/init.d/init.cssd stop'' to stop the oracle processes and also kill the tsnlstnr process if running(kill -9)\\

Back as orat2c\\
<code>./runinstaller</code>

File locations should be ok by default\\
Patch then should get installed, at the end it will ask to run as root:\\
<code>
/oracle/T2C/101_64/root.sh
</code>
(**choose to install to /usr/bin and not /usr/local/bin to be consistent with installer**)\\

do it then press "ok" and complete the oracle patch installer.\\

Possibly install extra patches to the patchset if necessary (didn't do)
<code>
#su - orat2c
#cd $ORACLE_HOME
#mkdir .patch_storage
#cd OPatch
#check current patches: ./opatch lsinventory
#./opatch apply -verbose /mnt/sapcd/Oracle_patches/10.1.0.4_linux64/.....
</code>


====Continue install====

Back in the SAP installer click "ok" to continue the install\\
Rest of install should complete succesfully.\\

Note: it seem to fail at step 24 "start java engine" seems to be out of memory issue
My solution is while it is running, login as t2cadm and do stopsap, then startsap ... that seem to work ....

At this stage it's good to reboot to free some memory before installing the patches.

=====post intsall=====

====Get a license====

start the admintool and go to the license adaptor and get the hardware key\\
then go to service.sap.com/licensekey to get the key and install it in visual admin.\\

====Installing the service pack====

For SP6 See: [[ISA 2004s SP06]]

For SP7 see: [[ISA 2004s SP07]]

07/19/2007: SR2/SP13, see: [[isa_2004s_server_-_upgrading_to_sr2_sp13_]]

====Recommanded settings====

Setup the JVM settings (using configtool) according to this note: 861215\\
Server: 
<code>
-Xgcpolicy:gencon -Xms2048m -Xmx2048m -Xmn400m -verbose:gc -Xtrace -Xsoftrefthreshold3 
 (-Xsoftrefthreshold1 if sp<5)
</code>
Dispatcher:
<code>
-Xgcpolicy:gencon -Xms200m -Xmx200m -Xmn70m -verbose:gc
</code>


====Start scripts to match solaris setup:====
created **/usr/local/adm** folder\\
in there created **SAP-startup.sh** with content 
<code>su - t2cadm -c startsap</code>
and created **SAP-shutdown.sh** with content
<code>su - t2cadm -c stoptsap</code>
and added to /etc/init.d/boot.local
<code>su - orat2c -c "/oracle/T2C/101_64/bin/lsnrctl start"</code>
Then ''Chmod +x'' all three files



====Starting the server====
After boot, as root:\\
<code>
/usr/local/adm/SAP-startup
</code>

NOTE Once, on first reboot would not start, had to: ''chmod 775 /usr/sap/tmp/dev_coll.tmp''

NOTE To get Other things to work right: ie JDI, had to do this:
<code>
''chown -R pdiadm:sapsys /usr/sap/''
</code>

===== SSL certificates =====
ISA comes with expired SSL certificates which causes lots of issues later, renew/ the certificates using this doc:

[[http://wiki.colar.net/sap_j2ee_ssl_keys]]

==== Visual Administrator stuck at 99% ====
If you can connect to remote machines form your Visual Administrator, but you can't connect to your local J2ee, it is probably due to name resolution issues.
Visual Administrator is VERY picky about this ! (i guess it probably does dns lokup & reverse DNS)

Anyway make sure your /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname are coorect, something like this:
<code | /etc/hosts>
127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.localdomain
10.10.1.195     sapmachine sapmachine.mycompany.com

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
# you might have ipv6 stuff here
</code>

<code | /etc/hostname>
sapmachine
</code>

===== Deploying the java components for CRM B2C/B2B =====

You can deploy those components also using the JSPM.
The components are: SAP-CRMJAV, SAP-CRMWEB, SAP-IPCMSA, SAP-SHRJAV, SAP-SHRWEB, SAP-CRMAPP, SAP-CRMDIC and SAP-SHRAPP (also has needed DICMS STRUTS TEALEAF)

''cp /mnt/sapcd/2004s_java_components/May\ 2006/* /usr/sap/trans/EPS/in/''

and run JSPM again to deploy those. (select "new components" and skip all except the components listed i just listed).

==== Performance enhancements====
See: [[sap_crm5_0_isa_trex_performance_settings]]

==== Setup B2c ====

See here on how to setup the ISA server/B2B/B2C sites
