======Mercurial / Bitbucket branch problem======

I want to create a branch to maintain an older version of my project.

Here is what I did:
''cd myprj''

I want to create my branch from rev 833
''hg update -r 833''  

''hg branch newbranch''

''hg commit -m "made a new branch from revision 833"''

**It doesn't want to create the branch unless i use -f, is that normal ?**
''hg push -f ''      

I think i'm already in the branch,  but just to make sure:
''hg up -C newbranch''

Then I make a change to a file
''echo "1" >> dummy.txt''

Then I commit/push, expecting it will commit to the branch 'newbranch'
''hg commit "Change to dummy.txt"''

''hg push''

Now when I look in bitbucket, **it appear my change went into the tip and not the branch**.

Also accoording to Merucurial doc, if i want to switch back to the "trunk", i would do:
''hg up -C default'' or ''hg up -C main''

But **Bitbucket does not have any default or main branch** even though the doc seem to say it should have created 'default' on the very first commit to that project

**Anybody knows what I'm doing wrong ????**
