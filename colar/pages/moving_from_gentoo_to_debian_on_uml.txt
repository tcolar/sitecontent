Note: When installing gallery (or othe rapache2 depnedat programs) it gives an error, and hangs while trying to rsetart apache (at the end of apt-get)
This is a knon issue.

Restarting apache by hand fixes it.

Here is a local copy, in case it goes down: [[postfix article copy]]

WARNING: Watch out when doing the addition to /etc/postfix/master.cf, the article code is missing the <tabs> which will make the code fail.

Copy this code instead:

<code>
smtp-amavis unix - - n - 2 smtp

	-o disable_dns_lookups=yes

</code>

To bypass the firewall at work (which blocks port 993 but not port 443 - http ssl) i also listen for imap on 443 (don't do this if you have a web server with SSL running !!), so that i can connect to imap on 443 from work.
/etc/courier/imap-ssl
SSL_PORT 993,443
/etc/init.d/courier-imap-ssl restart
NOTE: add to kill some hang courier-tcp process to be able to rseatrt and pickup the new port ! (tip: telnet 127.0.0.1 443 to test)

Also i changed in main.cf:
<code>
recipient-delimiter = -
</code>
so that addresses like me-* are received by me.

For user aliases, edit /etc/aliases and then run \\
<code>newaliases</code>


gallery, pure-ftpd, redir, dokuwiki, wget 

switching debian from stable to testing:\\
replace all "stable" by "testing" in /etc/apt/sources.list\\
also added to /etc/apt/sources
<code>deb http://secure-testing.debian.net/debian-secure-testing etch/security-updates main contrib non-free</code>
To get latest updates (ie: latest clamav)


apt-get update\\
