======Projects that I have built======
I really like building stuff, often it's software but once in a while I build actual things.
I'm not really the most gifted handyman but I do have some imagination.

**Here are a few things (non-software) that I have built with my own hands over the years:**

  * [[Classic Arcade]] (2012)
I Built an oldschool arcade from plywood and an old imac Mini.
Also made my own UI frontend software for it.

  * [[Ikea Standing Desk]] (2011)
Large but affordable and stylish, if I say so, standing desk I built from Ikea parts.
This project became somehow very popular and I get much traffic from it.
It somehow ended-up on sites such as Ikeahackers, mentalfloss and lifehackers among others.

  * [[zoozoobee,_my_home_built_camping_trailer|Camping Trailer]] (2010)
I did build a camping trailer from scratch, that was pretty fun and it's already traveled over 15K miles all over the American West since.

  * [[Car Mp3 Player]] (2000-2002) .... **very** poor English, sorry.
About the MP3 car player I built way back in 2000, when **NOBODY** had one yet.
It even had a feature to "say" the current song artist/title using text 2 speech (robot voice).

  * [[MythTV PVR]] (2005)
My Tv recorder  (computer + TV), once again nothing special nowadays but not many people had one then.
