I have been using Mythtv since 2005, and it's very neat.
This doc is only partial and from memory since i write it after installing.

=====What it does for me=====
I use it to record TV, and watch/pause live TV.\\
I can also use it to burn a movie to a DVD, and rip a DVD to the hard drive.

I also use it to store some of my music (rip my CD's) and play it back, as well as play online streams using mythstream.

=====My Hardware=====
I use an older Emachine (1.8Ghz).\\
It has a 40GB HD for the O/S and for the live TV cache, plus an external 200GB firewire hardrive for media storage (=~100h of video.)\\
I use an [[http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/products/data_pvr150.html | hauppauge PVR150]] card as the tuner, the video card is some generic S3 card.\\
I also have an universal remote from fry's, because i lost the PVR150 remote, and it wasn't very good anyhow (back then).

=====The Software =====
I use [[http://www.mythtv.org/ | MythTV]] for the software, in my opinion this is the best setup available (full feature, stable and free).

At first i used mythtv on gentoo, but it is a MAJOR pain to install and configure.

I now use [[http://www.mysettopbox.tv/knoppmyth.html | Knoppmyth]], which is a distro made for one and only one goal: run mythtv.\\
On top of that it provides a lot of extra features, and comes with all the needed drivers.\\
So if you configure installing a media center using mythtv, the way to go is knoppmyth (unless you are sadistic).

==== Setup ====
Well nothing to special here, just download and burn the Knopmyth CD and boot of it to install it.

Juts follow the guides here:\\
[[http://www.mysettopbox.tv/pamphlet.html]]\\
[[http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/User_Manual:Index]] \\

==== Partitions ====
I changed my parttions from the default, because i use an external (firewire) HD for the video storage.\\
So i have my partitons as follow \\
  * Disk1 (IDE 40GB internal) \\
hda1: /      3GB, system partiton\\
hda2: swap   600MB \\
hda3: /cache 4GB, live TV cache (about 100mn of paused TV) \\
hda4: /tmp   30GB: temporary files, i use that for example for encoding DVD's. \\

  * Disk2 (Firewire 200GB external) \\
sda1: /myth  200GB    this is the storage for all the media files (videos, recording, music etc ...)

Here is my /etc/fstab
<code>
# /etc/fstab: filesystem table.
#
# filesystem  mountpoint  type  options  dump  pass
/dev/hda1  /  auto defaults,errors=remount-ro  0  1
/dev/hda2 none swap defaults 0 0
/dev/hda3 /cache auto defaults,auto 0 0
/dev/hda4 /tmp auto defaults,auto 0 0
/dev/sda1  /myth  auto  defaults,auto  0  2

proc  /proc  proc  defaults  0  0
sysfs /sys   sysfs defaults  0  0
/dev/fd0  /floppy  vfat  defaults,user,noauto,showexec,umask=022  0  0
</code>

===== Upgrading to myth 0.20 =====
I use Knoppmyth R5D1, it uses mythtv 0.19\\
Mythtv 0.20 provides some great new tools, motable mytharchive which allows to burn dvd's of videos and recordings.\\
Here is how to upgrade to myth 0.20 and install mytharchive dependencies\\
To get a shell press CTRL+ALT+F1,   to go back to myth press CTRL+F7
<code>
echo "deb ftp://knoppmyth.net/R5 ./"  >> /etc/apt/sources.list 
apt-get update
dpkg -r libmyth-0.19 libmyth-0.19-dev mythtv mythtv-backend mythtv-common mythtv-database mythtv-debug mythtv-doc mythtv-frontend mythplugins mythburn-ui
rm -fr /usr/share/mythtv/mythweb
apt-get install mythtv mythplugins myththemes mythstream mythstreamtv
rm -fr /var/www/mythweb
ln -sf /usr/share/mythtv/mythweb /var/www 
apt-get install python-mysqldb python-imaging mjpegtools ffmpeg
</code>

WARNING You have to go to the "archive" in the setup, to define the mytharchive temporary directory, you should create a new directory (owned by mythtv).
<code>
# note: in my setup /tmp is 30GB +, in default knoppmyth instalation /myth is probably a better choice (larger partition).
mkir /tmp/mytharchive
chown mythtv:mythtv /tmp/mytharchive
</code>
** Wherever you put that directory, there should be a lot of free space preferably 10GB+, otherwise you will get all kind of errors when the disk gets full **

NOTE Using mytharchive is kinda confusing, you have to go to optical drives-> myth archive -> select files, and pick the files you will want to burn. THEN back out and go tu "Burn DVD" ...

===== Issues and resolutions=====
==== Ripping DVD's ====
If you want to copy(rip) your own DVD's to the computer, you will need the decryption library.\\

It is my belief i should be able to copy/backup my own DVD (that i have paid for) as i wish, unfortunately, the greedy monopolistic media companies in the US, had the greedy corporate run US government pass a law that makes this illegal. (well in any case it's illegal to decrypt a DVD, and without decrypting it you can't do much, like say convert it to mp4).

In any case to rip an encrypted DVD you will need the CSS library, which basically is used to crack the encryption, and thus is in theory illegal in the US.\\
Because of that, it does not come pre-install with knoppmyth, however there is a script you can run to install it.\\
If you don't DVD ripping will fail.

Here is how to install it:
<code bash>
# first you need to access a shell
# if you are in the mythtv frontend, you can press "CTRL-ALT-F1" to get to a shell
# log as root (or mythtv and then su as root), and run:
/usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh
</code>

After that, you should be able to rip DVD's.

Note: when ripping the DVD, you need to press "0" (ZERO) to start the rip, this confused me at first.

==== Playing back DVD's and other videos====

First after adding new videos, you need to go to setup->video library , this will refresh the list fo videos.

Second problem was that on my install (knoppmyth), i t would fail to play the videos.\\
The reason why, was that the path to mplayer was set improperly.

I found that mplayer was installed in /usr/bin   (by running 'which mplayer' on a shell)\\
So i had to go to: \\
**setup->media settings->video settings->playback** \\
and change /usr/local/bin/mplayer......  into /usr/bin/mplayer......

==== Remote control ====
{{URC6131.jpg}}

As i said i lost my Hauppauge remote and was not any good in the first place.\\
So i bought [[http://www.ofausa.com/remote.php?type=URC%206131 | this cheap universal remote]] (URC-6131) at Fry's and use it with the PVR150 I/R receiver instead.

There is a good doc on using/setting this up here:\\
[[http://www.vulturesnest.net/mythtvremote.html]]

However, i found the keys mapping to not be quite the way i wanted, so i modified them.\\
It is not all perfect, but it does all the most useful things like play, pause, change channel, sound, FF,RW, guide and things like that.

Here are my LIRC config files:

NOTE: i have  ran this command, so that i only have one lirc file (there seem to be two by default and it's confusing and seem not to work right)
<code>
cd /home/mythtv
rm .lircrc
ln -s .mythtv/lircrc .lircrc
</code>
