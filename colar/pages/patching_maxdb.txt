=====MaxDB / SAPDB control/DBM users passwords where lost/changed, Resetting it=====
At first i could not complete this, because the "control" user password was not "control" anymore and no matter what i tried (admin password, old password, install password) it would not take them.
So i had to reset the control password, here is how i did that.

I had some prompt and useful help from SDN (Thanks to  Markus D?r)

The magic thing was to use "c_J2EE"

  * Log as <SIDadm>
<code>
# replace <SID> with your system SID of course
sudo su - <SID>adm
cd /sapdb/programs/bin/
</code>

  * Using c_J2EE to reset "control" password:
<code>
./dbmcli -U c_J2EE
dbmcli on frenchie : ZTB>user_put control password=control
#OK
dbmcli on frenchie : ZTB>quit
#OK
</code>

  * We need to update the .XUSER62 file with the update password, using the xuser tool
./xuser set -U <SID>adm ?d ZTB ?u control,control

  * Checking we can login now:
<code>
./dbmcli -d ZTB -u control,control
dbmcli on ZTB>
# Yeah, we are in !
/code>

Otherwise you would have got:
<code>
./dbmcli -d ZTB -u control,dsffsdfdsf
Error! Connection failed to node (local) for database ZTB:
-24950,ERR_USRFAIL: User authorization failed
</code>

  * Restart SAP after that (stopsap, startsap)
