======Processing a binary newsgroup file (Divx, etc...)====== 

Once all the part of a movie are downloaded with BNR (*.rar and some *.par2), first run the check too see they are not broken: (use the command par2verify with any of the par2 file)
par2verify myvovie.par2
If it all goes well, good, otherwise you will have to use the command "par2repair"
Now let's recreate the full movie: (unrar any of the .rar file, it will unrar them all)
unrar mymovie-part1.rar
Now you got your movie, if it fits one one CD (<800MB) go burn it with cdrecord or K3B or whatever burning tool, if not then let's split it in 2 pieces first.
Let's do piece number one with the first hour of the movie:
<code bash>
mencoder -endpos 1:00:00 -oac copy -ovc copy -o mymovie-1.avi mymovie.avi
</code>
Lets' do the second piece with the rest of the movie:
<code bash>
mencoder -ss 00:59:30 -oac copy -ovc copy -o mymovie-2.avi mymovie.avi
</code>
