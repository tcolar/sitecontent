======SAP B2C / B2B projects customization to run on Tomcat======
====Create the new B2C/B2B projects====
  - In your IDE of choice, **create a new "java web(J2EE)" project** 

For example in Netbeans: File/new project/java web/Web Application
Name: For example "b2c_mine"

Context: "/b2c_mine"
Web pages folder: "webcontent" 
Web-INF folder : "webcontent/WEB-INF/"
Source Format: **"Java 1.4"**
Run options - java "-Xmx800m"
You can select "Deploy on Save"
Target server: **Choose the custom tomcat previously built**
Target J2EE version: **"J2EE 1.4"**

  - **Create a folder called "local_web_patches"** in the web project root (ex: /home/me/NetBeansProjects/b2c_mine/local_web_patches), this will contain all the customized items for local deployment only (not to be deployed on a SAP engne).

===Copy the vanilla sources===
Locate the SAPSHRAPP*.sca file. 
This is typically found on the "Java componnents" DVD.

Open the file witha zip utility, ex: ''file-roller SAPSHRAPP02_0-10005559.SCA''

Browse to DEPLOYARCHIVES/

Browse to(unzip) crm~b2c.sda (B2C) OR crm~b2b.sda (B2B)
Extract the content of src.zip somewhere of your choice: Those are the java sources for B2B/B2C and might be useful later for reference/debugging.

Unzip all the content of the war file (ex: sap.com~crm~isa~web~b2c.war) into your new project webcontent folder (b2c_mine/webcontent/)

FIXME: extract META_INF (and how to modify it)
Unzip the content of the META-INF folder (in crm~b2c.sda) into your new project webcontent/META-INF/ folder (b2c_mine/webcontent/META-INF/)




customize build file
