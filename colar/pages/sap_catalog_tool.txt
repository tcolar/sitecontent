======SAP Catalog tool======
I've been messing with writing a faster more efficient tool for SAP CRM Catalog maintenance.
It's written in Fan, using FWT.

Anyway it's very early and mostly useless, but i wanted to highlight two features that should absolutely be standard in SAP's standard GUI:
  - **Export a table to CSV** (so you can print it or look at it in Excell)
  - **Translate a Cell to English**, becuase lots of infos are in German! (Using Google translate API)

See Demo:
