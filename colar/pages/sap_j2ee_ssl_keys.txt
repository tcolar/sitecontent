The SAP webas engine comes with expired SSL keys.

To have the proxy working right, those keys need to be replaced.

  - first thing to do is in the visual administrator, go to the server instance key store and create a new ssl key/cert

  - Then go to the dispatcher instance and tell it to use the newly created ssl key/cert

  - Then stop and then (re)start the ssl provider

Go to https://host:50101/   (or whichever port SSL is set to use) and check the certificate in the browser to see if it picked up the new one.

NOTE:  sometimes it seem the whole j2ee engine needs to be restarted to pick up the new certificate.
