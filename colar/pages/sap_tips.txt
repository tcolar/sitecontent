WARNING: **As of April 2011, I took a new job and no longer using SAP.**

====== SAP Tips ======
At work I'm the senior E-Commerce architect (a.k.a The Java guy).
We use an SAP platform, when I started here that was new to me so I had a lot to learn, quite a stretch from the open source world.

I mostly work on our custom B2C/B2B implementations on top of SAP Netweaver(SAP Internet Sales) with a CRM backend.
That is mostly Java, although we also incorporated OSS technologies in our implementations, such as using Sitemesh, Subversion and Hudson.

Here are some of our implementations (Heavenly customized):
[[http://www.pacificcoast.com/]] (B2C)
[[http://www.sealybedding.com/]] (B2C)
[[http://www.pcf.com/]] (B2B)
[[https://b2b.pcint.com/]] (B2B international / China - older impl.)

It seems there are not a lot of documentation/blogging going on about this .. I guess because it's secretly guarded by highly paid consultants, anyway that is not how I roll, I find documenting what I find being help to myself later, once I've forgotten, and why not help others while at it ?
