======Configuring a B2B/B2C site======

=====Configuring from scratch=====

**Common to all sites:**

Setting up the shopadmin:
[[http://127.0.0.1:50000/shopadmin/admin/xcm/init.do]]

You need to restart the shopadmin application now (in Visual admin)

Configuring the Shopadmin:
[[http://127.0.0.1:50000/shopadmin/shopadmin/init.do]]

Setting/Configuring the web shop:
[[http://127.0.0.1:50000/webcatadmin/admin/xcm/init.do]]

restart the webcatadmin app now.

**For ecah B2B/B2C app:**
(replace the first /b2c by your actual application name).

[[http://127.0.0.1:50000/b2c/admin/xcm/init.do]]  (Main XCM + IPC XCM)

restart the b2c/b2b app now.

=====Saving the Config=====

For each link click "XCM settings" and then download both files.
Note: save in different folders, since they have the same names.


**Common:**
[[http://127.0.0.1:50000/shopadmin/admin/xcm/init.do]]
[[http://127.0.0.1:50000/shopadmin/shopadmin/init.do]]
[[http://127.0.0.1:50000/webcatadmin/admin/xcm/init.do]]

**For each B2C/B2B app:**
[[http://127.0.0.1:50000/b2c/admin/xcm/init.do]] (save the main XCM)
Then change the "Application configuration for" combo to "IPC"
and save again the IPC XCM files.

=====Loading the config (from a save)=====

You can reload the files you saved uploaded from the same links.
For each link: click "XCM settings", and **then click "edit"** to go to edit mode, this will give you the "upload" fields.

Warning: After uploading the files, **do not forget to click 'Display' to go back to display mode**, otherwise you risk locking yourself out and won't be able to edit for a while.

Note: for PCF we have the XCM files saved under Subversion (xcm_bcakups project)

Warning: when uploading any of those config files from saves, **you will have to go retype the jco passwords** under components/customer/JCO otherwise they won't work (encryption).


**Common:**
