On June 6 206 i ordered a hot tub fom an online retailer [[ http://www.hottubheadquarters.com  | Hot tub Headquarters ]]\\
Once ordered and paid, the spa went into production, which took about 3 weeks, until end of june.\\

Then it was ready to ship but wasn't shipped for another 2 weeks until July 14.

The shipping as been an absolute enormous screwup like i ave never seen before, as of now August 15, i still haven't received the tub !!

Here are some of the email excahnges i had:
  * With the seller, Frank at Hot Tub heaquarter who was a great communicator before the purchase but almost impossible to talk to after the purchase was placed.

  * With the shipping company ([[http://www.spectransinc.com | Specialized Transit]] / STI and [[http://www.navl.com | North american Van Lines / NAVL]] , and finaly, [[http://www.airvan.net | Air Van Lines]] ) which managed to screw up 4 different times on the same order !!

This has been completely insane, so if you ever plan to move anything valubale through any of those carriers, you might want to read this first !!

Hello, i'm the recipient of
order **SL7216** (hot tub)
I have a few question:
1) it says estimated shipping
date 13 or 14 of july, yet we are
17th and it seem it has not
shipped yet, is that normal ? did it
ship or will it ship soon ?
2) The product company said you
can often provide backyard delivery
for a fee, do you provide that
service, and if yes how do i arrange
that and what is the fee. (it's
either 30 feet from the curb with 3
stairs, or 100 feet around the
houses with no stairs)

Let me know, thank you.

I still haven't got any reply to
this querry ...
The trcaking information says the
truck is in "Carol st, IL" but it
has been saying this for 2 days
already, and the delivery date seem
to be pushed back to one day
later, each day .
Is this normal and/or is the
trcaking information innacurate ?
Also i want to talk about the
backayrd delivery options etc ... is
there a phone number i should
call for all with this ?
I can be reached by email or at

Thank you.

                                    not put the spa in any inclosed areas.
                                    You will need to make sure they have a
                                    clear path. If you fall into all these
                                    guide lines we can do a backyard del.

                So it will take 2 weeks just to get to Everett and then
                probably another to be delivered locally ?
                seems like a very long time. It took only 3 days to get
                from Chicago to Everett on the wrong delivery.

                In any case i will have to try to arrange to be around
                when it does show up, so as your delivery estimate gets
                more accurate, please let me know, i get to travel a bit

Good Morning,

      This spa was setup on a A-Portion for pickup out of cust. 
driveway 7-31 through 8-1  it hasn't pickup yet.  
It was switched with contract SL6975, which was also setup as a
 A-Portion and now has been correctly del. by 7305.
  Vince @ 7012 has been out on medical leave and a Gentleman by
 the name of Mike has been covering for him.
  I was dealing with him all last week about picking up this spa.  
He had it scheduled to pickup on the 1st of Aug. 
only for it not to happen.  Again on the 3rd.  
When I called to confirm with him on Thurs that it was being
 picked up he said no.  I told him I needed it pickup ASAP.  
I told him Fri.  Confirmed with him that the cust. 
doesn't need to be there.  The cust. wants this out of his driveway.
  I see in notes that someone left the cust. 
a mess today to schedule pickup.  
This is unacceptable and I feel Mike is not doing his job.  
I will forward all of you the e-mails I have been receiving from
 the cust. who is actually suppose to be receiving this spa.  
He is very frustrated and it wouldn't surprise me if he 
ends up canceling.  What are we going to do to compensate him.  
He needs to be compensated.  
The way this has been being handle by 7012 is 
making STI look bad!!!  Can someone please get back with me
 and let me know everything is now taken care of!!  
Thank you for your time.

    Toni, don?t understand why you feel 7012 should be charged back? 
The original shipment shows spa originated out of manufacture
 in Grand Rapids, MI. 
The ?A? portion for what reason though originated out of 
another vendor for Empire Surplus in Yorktown, VA. 
The Jessup DC loaded the spa within the load spread. 
Also it appears the spa is scheduled to set off at Air Van
 within the committed transit dates. 
Pertaining to your request for some form of compensation 
I would be willing to have the Seattle DC provide a backyard 
delivery if there are no obstructions i.e. fence, low utility 
wires, trees, etc. and it can be performed safely with 2-3 men.
 Thanks

Hello Mr. Colar,

  I  want to apologize for all of your inconvenience.  
As it looks your spa is now scheduled to get into Everett, WA. 
on the 15th and you will receive del. that week.  
Per my e-mail to our Corporate Office in Fort, Wayne, IN. 
They have auth. to provide a backyard  del. w/ no charge to you.  
Again I do apologize.  Please be advised that we will provide
 a backyard, but you must be in our guidelines of del.  
No more then 300ft.  Your property must be fairly level.  
We don't do up or downhill grades.  No obstructions in our way. 
If you have a fence the gate opening must be no less then 48 inches. 
We will not remove the pallet till it is in place. 
We will not lift the spa in anyway.  We will put on a deck, 
but no more then 30 inches off the ground with no more
 then 3 steps.  Must remove rails. 
If you fall into these guidelines there shouldn't be 
any problems.  If you have any questions please feel free
to contact me @ 800 xxx xxxx

Thanks for trying to help.

Seem like "Brian Day" missed the point that the tub
was not supposed to ship from VA, but only got there
because of the original shipping mix-up.

Anyhow, hopefully it will finally get here.

I am now a bit worried of it arriving without damages
after this long "road-trip" and storage all over the place
.. hopefully nothing happened.

For the backyard delivery, there is a tiny bit of slope
from my front yard to my backyard as i originally stated
(about 2-3' over a length of 30', so really not that 
steep at all, but i am not sure what means "fairly flat"),
 i originally chose this seller, because they provided
the delivery though you with the backyard delivery option.

I can provide you a picture of the lot "grade"
 if that helps, let me know.

Thank you for trying to get this resolved.

**08/11/06** \\
From the delivery info i manged to see who had my tub and their address and from there found thyr email on google and emailed them.\\
Basically they are the people whose spa got mixed up with mine, and i learned my tub was stuck for 2weeks in their driveway !!\\
<code>
Hello, sorry to bother you.
I ordered a hot tub myself from hot tub headquarters, and apparently our tubs got mixed up during delivery (i live near seattle, WA)  my tracking number was SL7216

As fas as i understand it, my tub is still seating in your driveway ....
If that is the case, could you do me a favor.

I'm trying to figure if i should cancel my delivery, i am worried the tub might have been damaged by now.  Could you help me and let me know if it's still in good shape and wrapped properly etc ...

I'm getting frustrated with all this and i am sure you properly are as well if my hot tub is still seating in your driveway.

I attached the emails i got from the delivery company (STI) if that helps clarifying the situtation.

Thank you.

Here is waht they answered:\\
<code>
Hello,
 
This is crazy I am disgusted with the responses as well.  I hold Hot Tub Head quarters responsible as the replies from them ( who I gave my credit card to ) was not very helpful and I can see the same as for you by you having to contact the shipping directly.  IT WAS FRANKS JOB TO GET IT RIGHT !!!!
 
The tub sat in my driveway for over a week wrapped and was in good shape from what appeared I never uncovered it only peaked inside. I called HT HQ the day I received it  They came to pick it up about a week and a half go   truck was to small  finally picked it up Thursday th 10th and away she went .
 
I have now been promised my Black tub on Tuesday  I had called my credit card company to cancel now finally they say oh we found it  only after I did all the leg work on identifying the problem.
 
I too am extremely frustrated with this whole mess.   I just know my tub will arrive and there be a problem with it and the time limit will be up  for  canceling the card.  I paid for it on 26  June .
 
Was the same conditioned as delivered appeared OK
 
I am curious how did you get my email?
 
Regards,
Ken

**08/14/06**: The tub finally arrived to the local warehouse in Everett, WA.
I called the warehouse and they promised delivery on 08/16/06, they could not provide any delivery window more precise than 8am to 5pm.\\
So had to take a day off from work.

**08/16/06**: 3PM, still no truck. I call them and they say: sorry we only have 2 people available today and 3 are required to deliver the spa.\\
Tell them i took a day off just for this for nothing and theycould at least have called me, gives excuses as usual .... promised it will be here tomorow at 7am sharp .... in light of the traffic at 7am between Everett and Kent i doubt it .... ho well will see.

**08/17/06**: 6:45am, driver calls me ant tell me he will be late because his truck door is broken ?? and needs to be fixed now.

**08/17/06**: 8:30am: still nobody here, the driver helpers are somewhere else and are not coming, driver tells me it might be a few hours if it ever happens at all today, i decided this is BS and tell them to call me whenenver they get there, and head to work.

I am so mad at all this B.S. at this point, that i decide to write a letter to all the companies involved in this mess, using all the email addresses i can find online for as many managers as possible:

<code>
Ok, i have been nice with you guys despite all the screw-up, but i got plenty enough now.

What do you guys need to do your job right? a LAWSUIT ??

Frank at HotTubHeadquarters, i purchased with you, and since i have had problems you have not replied to my emails, end everytime i called, after asking my name, i've been told everytime that you where in a "meeting" ... hum it is interesting how you did not have that many meetings when i had questiosn before placing the order.

As for NAVL/STI, this delivery as been the worst customer experience ii EVER HAD.
After sending the tub to the wrong state (virginia instead if washington state !!), it was left in somebody's driveway for 2 weeks.
When it was finally retrieved and got here, i was promised delivery yesterday, which i took a PRECIOUS day off for, of course nobody showed up.
I was promised delivery this morning before going to work, i woke up at 6am just for nothing once again, as it stands the delivery seem as it won't happen once again.

If you want the full story, i started creating a webpage here:
Be insured i'll improved that webpage and make it as public as i can for everybody to see, yes you messed up with a software developer.

If the tub is not delivered today, i'm cancelling this order and taking action.

After that i left to work and asked to be called once they get there.

At NOON they finally call me, i get to my home and we finally get that SPA out of the truck.
The Spa as a few minor scratch that i choose to ignore because it's just too much hassle.

** THE SPA COVER IS MIISING !! **
Since the cover is missing i can't use the spa yet of course !!

I called Frank and he said he will send me a new cover rather than try to locate the lost one.

**08/25/06:**
They finally send the cover !
