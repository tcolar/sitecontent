======Stylus2X======
I created a project called [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/stylus2x/|Stylus2X on sourceforge]]

The aim of this project is to provide some applications with built-in keyboard support (virtual onscreen keyboard).

=====Project Goals=====
====Virtual Keyboards====
This is an onscreen keyboard you can use the stylus on to simulate keystrokes, i provide to versions:
  * one compact using little screen real-estate, to be used with the stylus.
  * one much larger, that you can easily use with your fingers.

====Built-in Apps====
  * A shell (bash) - 90% done
  * A music player - TBD
  * An application launcher - TBD
  * A GP2X monitor (battery, CPU) - TBD

=====Installation=====
  * First you will need to download python/pygame for GP2X
[[http://archive.gp2x.de/cgi-bin/cfiles.cgi?0,0,0,0,14,917]]
Simply open that archive and extract it to the root of your SD card (so thatthe "python" folder is at the root of the SD)

  * Then download Stylus2X from [[https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=232381]] and extract it on your SD card.

=====Credits=====
A big thanks to those opensource/GPL apps i made good use of in this project:
  * Python/Pygame for GP2X (for whoever ported it)
[[http://wiki.gp2x.org/wiki/Pygame]]

  * The [[http://www.noah.org/wiki/Pexpect|Pexpect package]], making the python process management much easier, as well as providing ANSI screen support for python.

  * Eric Meyers, who took the time to provide a [[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2005-March/311726.html|good example on how to use the Pexpect Ansi.py code]].

  * The [[http://www.gnome.org/fonts/|Gnome BitStream VeraBD Monospace font]], which look great ona  small screen like the GP2X

  * [[http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet/wiki/Development/Mutagen|Mutagen]], which allows easy but powerful access to music metadata in python.
