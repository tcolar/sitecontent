======SVN merge does nothing / broken======

So i was trying to make that a big svn merge, just like have done in the past [[http://wiki.colar.net/sp7_to_sp13_subversion_branching_merging]].

Well i expected the new syntax (merge traking of svn 1.5) to make it even easier, like this:
<code>
cd working_copy
svn merge --dry-run http://server/svn/branches/pcf_java
</code>

But all i would get is this (as if it found nothing to merge):
<code>
svn: REPORT of '/svn/!svn/bc/2213/pcf_java': 200 OK (http://svn1.pcf.com)
</code>
Not really an error, but nothing returned either ... hum.
''svn diff'' and manual evaluation did report the difference, yet ''svn merge'' would do nothing ... strange.

Searched for a while online but found nothing clear.

Finally looked at the server side logs :
<code |  tail /var/log/apache2/error.log>
[Tue Apr 28 15:13:53 2009] [error] [client 10.10.1.195] Provider encountered an error while streaming a REPORT response.  [501, #0]
[Tue Apr 28 15:13:53 2009] [error] [client 10.10.1.195] Error writing REPORT response.  [501, #200007]
[Tue Apr 28 15:13:53 2009] [error] [client 10.10.1.195] The 'node-origins' feature requires version 3 of the filesystem schema; filesystem '/var/lib/svn/db' uses only version 2  [501, #200007]
</code>

That error got me somewhere, and apparently after you upgrade svn you need to run ''svnadmin upgrade''.

I had upgraded from svn 1.4 to 1.5 few month ago, through apt-get and of course not read the UPGRADE doc (who does :-) ) .... and didn't know about that.

Anyhow, now you and I know:

WARNING: **After upgrading the svn server, run manually ''svnadmin upgrade'' and maybe ''svnadmin recover file:///var/lib/svn/project'' as well, or better read the UPGRADE doc :-)**
