====== Installing Trails ======

===== Java / Ant =====

Follow the guide here:\\
[[http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/06/23/trails.html | Trails Article]]

Install java 1.5\\
ans set JAVA_HOME correctly\\

Install ant1.6\\
and set ANT_HOME correctly\\

===== Tomcat 5.5 =====
Install tomcat **5.5** \\

Note: on debian I had installed both pakages tomcat5 and tomcat5-admin,
However This did not work, i was getting this error:

<code>
/home/thibautc/test2/build.xml:146: 
FAIL - Encountered exception java.io.IOException: 
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 
Context path is required
</code>

After further research, I realized debian had installed Tomcat 5.0 and not 5.5.\\
Rails **requires 5.5** so i had to install that.\\
I did not find Debian packages for this, so did it manually:

Download from here:\\
http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi

Those packages:\\
apache-tomcat-5.5xxx.tar.gz\\
apache-tomcat-5.5xxx-admin.tar.gz\\
apache-tomcat-5.5xxx-deployer.tar.gz

Then, install them
<code>
tar xzvf apache-tomcat-5.5xxx.tar.gz
tar xzvf apache-tomcat-5.5xxx-admin.tar.gz
tar xzvf apache-tomcat-5.5xxx-deployer.tar.gz
#need to install tomcat somewhere
mv apache-tomcat-5.5xx /usr/share/tomcat5
# set TOMCAT_HOME=/usr/share/tomcat5
# ie: /etc/profile etc ...
</code>
In theory also chown -R tomcat5 /usr/share/tomcat5 \\
however in my case it would not run unless I was root \\
probably some permissions issue, anyhow for now i'll be a pig and run it as root :-) until i figure it out.

and make sure to start tomcat ! 

===== Eclipse + Plugins =====

If you don't have eclipse yet, install it:\\
Download from \\
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ \\

And install && choose a  workspace location\\

Then install Some useful Eclipse plugins:
Click in Evlipse "help"/"software update"/"find and install", "search for new features to install"\\
new remote site : Spindel plugin: http://spindle.sourceforge.net/updates \\
new remote site : Ajdt Plugin: http://download.eclipse.org/technology/ajdt/31/update \\
Click finish\\
choose a miror\\
and select to install spindle and ajdt\\
accept the license\\
click install all.\\

get doclipse here : http://www.beust.com/doclipse/ \\
And unzip in eclipse_home/plugins/

Restart Eclipse after this.

===== Install Trails =====
get latest trails here\\ 
https://trails.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList \\
and extract it somewhere (! in eclipse workspace)\\
<code>
cd /home/thibautc
unzip trails-0.8.zip
</code>

===== Creating the project =====
go in there (/home/thibautc/trails) and run : 
<code>
ant create-project
> basedir: /home/thibautc
> project name: trailstest
</code>

Go in /home/thibautc/trailstest\\
edit "build.properties" 
<code>
tomcat.home=/usr/share/tomcat5
# default is usually 8080, on my debian it's 8180 because it found tomcat4 on 8080
tomcat.url=http://localhost:8080
manager.username=trails
manager.password=pass
</code>

Edit {tomcat_home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml (as root) and make sure to define a trails user/password matching the one defined in tomcat-users:
<code>
<user name="trails" password="pass"
      roles="standard,manager" />
</code>

===== Creating and deploying the project =====
Start Eclipse\\
Click "new", "Project", "java project"\\
Name: trailstest\\
Choose "Existing location": /home/thibautc/trailstest

Open the "java" perspective (window/perspective/others/java)\\
in package explorer, right click on "trailtests" and open the "properties"\\
go to "java build path" / "sources", add the "src" folder.\\
also in the tapestry section, check "is a tapestry project" (optional)\\

In Eclipse "window"/"preferences":\\
in the "java",  "compiler" section, select "java 1.5"  (1.4 won't do with annotations)\\
Also in "Ant", "Runtime", "Classpath", "Ant home entries", "add jars" and add "trailstest/lib/apt-ant.jar" (not sure this is needed anymore)\\
Make sure here that "Ant Home" is set correctly (to ant 1.6).

Then do "New", "Class" and call it Recipe so the class gets created.\\

Enter this for the Recipe.java code: \\

Note: **Don't copy this colored code from here, it somehow won't compile! ** \\
However, you can click [[http://www.colar.net/recipe.txt | here]] to copy it in plain text, which will work.\\

<code java>
import java.util.Date;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratorType;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class Recipe
{
    private Integer id;
    
    private String title;
    
    private String description;
    
    private Date date;

    @Id(generate=GeneratorType.AUTO)
    public Integer getId()
    {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Integer id)
    {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getTitle()
    {
        return title;
    }

    public void setTitle(String title)
    {
        this.title = title;
    }

    public String getDescription()
    {
        return description;
    }

    public void setDescription(String description)
    {
        this.description = description;
    }
    
    public Date getDate()
    {
        return date;
    }

    public void setDate(Date date)
    {
        this.date = date;
    }
    
}
</code>
and Save.

Open the "ant" view, and add trailstest/build.xml\\
Then run the "deploy" target (dbl click)\\

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/trailstest/
