From 2004 on, i many time considered buying a camping trailer.
I always wanted something light and compact, such as to get good millage and being towable by a "normal" vehicle (Subaru Outback), so something under 2000 punds, preferably more like 1200.

I've considered many commercial options over the years, and documented some [[camping_trailer | here]]. 

But with one(then 2 child) teardrops where to small, and other larger trailers where either too heavy or very expensive for what they are.

So eventually I decided to make my own (i'm decent at building things, but never had i done anything of this scale).

Anyway 9 months later (could have been <4) I had my own camping trailer !
