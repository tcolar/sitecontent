======Ubuntu Draper on Evo N610C======

=====VPN=====
I could not get vpnc to work, so i used the cisco client (non free) that we own at my company.

To compile the cisco vpn client i apparently had to compile a kernel.\\
it seems headers + buildtools was not enough\\
I would get this error: scripts/mod/modpost: No such file or directory\\

====Install kernel====
<code>
apt-get install linux-kernel-dev linux-sources linux-headers build-essential

cd /usr/src/linux
#copying the default ubuntu config
cp /boot/config-2.6.15-25-38 .config
make menuconfig  
# just exit/save right away, config is ok already.

#on my machine ZD12111 would fail to compile, so edit .config and comment it out
#CONFIG_USB_ZD1211=N

make  
</code>
 
# will run for 1hour +

====Install Cisco client====
<code>
tar xzvf vpnclient-xxxx.tgz
cd vpnclient
./vpn_install
#start at boot -> yes
</code>

====Install gvpndialer====
This is a nice gui to the cisco vpn client (provides gnome icon etc ...) \\
Download gvpn-dialer: https://sourceforge.net/projects/gvpn-dialer/ \\
get the rpm (we will use alien to convert it into a .deb)

<code>
sudo apt-get install alien
sudo alien gvpn-dialerxxx.rpm
sudo dpkg -i gvpndialer_1.1-2_i386.deb
#there is a missing libpcre.so.0 just linking it to .so.3 fixes it
cd /usr/lib
sudo ln -s libpcre.so.3 libpcre.so.0
</code>

start it.\\
edit preferences (set cisco client path and profile path)\\
create icon somewhere ('gksudo gvpndialer')


=====Wireless network=====

====Getting the driver to work====

My card (Airlink AWLC3025) was not working right, after long search i found that the acx driver was not working properly, and also it was conflicting with ndiswrapper, so i choose to disable the acx driver.

vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
<code>
blaclist acx
</code>

then install the windows card driver
<code>
ndiswrapper -i /tmp/tnet1130.inf
</code>

unplug and then plug back the card, it then should work.

====Setting the interfaces and using whereami====
I switch back and forth from home(wireless) to (work) wired, with "whereami" i can configure bothe network and get it to switch automaticaly to whichever is detected

See infos about whereami here:\\
http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24994&highlight=wireless+connect+automatically

<code>
apt-get install whereami
</code>

Here is my setup:
/etc/whereami/detect.conf
<code>
default wireless
testmii eth0 lan

if lan
	set INTERFACE eth0
	at wired
	notat down
fi
</code>

/etc/whereami/whereami.conf
<code>
+wired setresolver nameserver 199.249.215.3
+wired cp /etc/network/interfaces.work /etc/network/interfaces
+wired /etc/init.d/networking restart
+wireless setresolver nameserver 190.168.0.1
+wireless cp /etc/network/interfaces.home /etc/network/interfaces
+wireless /etc/init.d/networking restart
</code>

/etc/network/interfaces.work
<code>
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

iface eth0 inet static
address 10.10.1.188
netmask 255.255.255.0

</code>

/etc/network/interfaces.home
<code>

</code>

=====System suspend/Hibernate=====
Hibernate works great out of the box

Suspend does not work, i never got it to work on this machine with any distro.\\
With ubuntu it goes to sleep, but can't be wake back up.

I give up on that, hibernate is good enough for me.
