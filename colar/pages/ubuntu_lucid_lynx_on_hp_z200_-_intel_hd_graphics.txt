======Ubuntu Lucid Lynx on HP Z200 - Intel HD graphics======

It mostly worked out of the box, except that xorg would only offer me some crappy resolutions (max 1370x768 or so) and be unable to detect my display, so I had to make my own xorg.conf.

Here is some of the process:

===== Manually configuring the screen (xorg.conf)=====

Note: **You have to be careful when manually setting xorg.conf, you could potentially damage your monitor, although that mostly applies to CRT monitors (LCD's are safer)**


My video card is a built-in Intel graphics HD (in processor), the driver for that on linux is i915 (which worked fine) ... **however it can't detect the display correctly though that chip**, so it only offers lame "safe" *VGA resolutions.

Note: Interestingly If I add a PCI graphic card and plug the same display to it, then it DOES detect the monitor fine


====Getting infos about the graphic card and monitor====
<code>
lspci | grep Graphic
    00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)
</code>

My monitor is a Dell 23" widescreen (E2310HC)

First we need to know what the monitor can do, you can use (LCD monitor)

''sudo dccprobe''

This will tell you a lot about the monitor and what what it can do.

It is best to check the manufacturer specs if available, for example for me it was available at:
[[http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/MONITORS/E2010H/en/ug/about.htm]]

====Setting up the sync/refresh rates====
Anyway, from the manufacturer specs and/or dccprobe output we need to find the **Horisontal Sync rates** and **Vertical refresh rates**

In my case: 30-83   &  50-76
So we want to add those to the "Monitor" section of /etc/X11/Xorg.conf

Tip: See my whole /etc/X11/xorg.conf at the end of this post (you might have to create that file if it doesn't exist yet on your system)


<code>
	HorizSync 	30-83
	VertRefresh	50-75
</code>

====Setting up the resolution modes====
From the manufacturer specs and/or dccprobe you should know what resolutions are available (at which refresh rate), so we want to add the one we are interested in in the Screen/Display section.

In my case:
<code>
        Modes	"1920x1080@60" "1600x900@75" "1152x864@75" "1024x768@75"
</code>

NOTE: The way Ubuntu works now, I think that is only used by the login screen, once in X this is not used (it seems to use the results from the ''xrandr'' command instead)

====Setting up ModeLines====
After setting the previous settings I was able to get "better" refresh rates (up to ~1700*1200) but not the best possible ones and some odd ones.

''xrandr'' was able to guess those better resolutions using refresh/sync rates we provided but it's not enough infos to get it all "right"

So we need to specify ModeLines to get the optimal setup.

Luckily there is a cool tool to find out Modelines, ''cvt''
So use CVT to find the modeline for each resolution we are interested in

For example 1920x1080 @ 60Hz:

''cvt 1920 1080 60''

Repeat for each resolution, then we can add the Modeline entries to the Monitor section:
<code>
Modeline "1920x1080_60.00"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
Modeline "1600x900_75.00"  151.25  1600 1704 1872 2144  900 903 908 942 -hsync +vsync
Modeline "1152x864_75.00"  104.00  1152 1224 1344 1536  864 867 871 905 -hsync +vsync
</code>

====Restart X windows====
You can either kill the "gdm" process or simply reboot.

Now we have all the nice resolutions available

====My xorg.conf====

WARNING: **Do not just copy that "As is" the refresh rates and modelines might not work and even DAMAGE your screen, adjust those as explain in this post**
