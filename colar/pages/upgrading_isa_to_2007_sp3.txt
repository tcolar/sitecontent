#Got the stack here: https://service.sap.com/sp-stacks (need to allow popups)\\
#got the 2007 SP3 stack and add the files to the basket and use the download manager to save

</code>

=====Patching=====

Do all JSPM stuffs as sidadm. \\

copy all the patch files (SAR,JAR etc ...)\\

Note: I had to create those folders manually as root and then chown them to sidadm


<code>
mkdirhier /usr/sap/trans/EPS/in
cp  /sapcd/PATCHES_SP\'s/2007/SP03/* /usr/sap/trans/EPS/in

#also we need to copy the linux specific stuffs (kernel)
cp /sapcd/PATCHES_SP\'s/2007/SP03/Linux_64/*  /usr/sap/trans/EPS/in

chown -R sidadm /usr/sap/trans/
</code>

start (as sidadm)''go'' in /usr/sap/SID/JC01/j2ee/JSPM/ (takes a while for the gui to comeup)\\

Enter the password to login the JSPM\\
do "single packages" and choose all the packages, click next\\

"go" in /usr/sap/SID/JC00/j2ee/JSPM/ \\

Enter the password to login the SDM\\

Ans it will continue the upgrade with all the other packages ~1 hour.
