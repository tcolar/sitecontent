======My software TODO list======
===Berry4All===
Implement alternate connection method not using ppp, but instead have a python "http proxy" on the computer talking through USB(and maybe bluetooth too) to an app(midlet) on the phone - this would use the data plan rather than be considered tethering.
===MIGLayout===
Implement MigLayout for Fantom.
===FantomIDE===
Try to get my plugin released on Netbeans plugin portal.
===SAP CRM Cat tool===
Continue development
===Other "top-secret" ideas===
  - Work on the "tracking pixel" idea
  - Work on the "barcode" idea
