===== Model not mapped error =====

I was having this weird problem where my dataBinder code would not work.\\
Everytime i got a "Model not mapped" error.\\
See the code here\\
[[DataBinder Issue]]

Anyway turn out that the reason was that i (or rather eclipse) had imported:\\
<code java>
org.hibernate.annotations.Entity
</code>
instead of:
<code java>
javax.persistence.entity
</code>
That is why it was failing ! \\
Thanks to Nathan Hamblen, the Databinder author for helping with this.
