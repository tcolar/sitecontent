<code>
Use SAP MMC / visual admin, to shut down the system (if still working/running)
Can also use: c:\usr\sap\ZTB\JC01\exe\  sapsrvkill FRENCHIE_ZTB_00    (and _01)
remove (or backup) old c:/usr/sap
Also if want to keep old j2ee, rename c:\jdt into c:\jdt_old
# to remove the old MaxDB (Note: 599129)
(Have to stop the db first : dbmstop.exe -d ztb)
C:\sapdb\programs\pgm
run "dbmcli db_enum" to find runnign db instances (found ZTB)
then "dbmcli -d ZTB -u control,control db_offline"
then "dbmcli -d ZTB -u control,control db_drop"
cd C:\sapdb\programs\bin
sdbuninst.exe -all
remove or backup old c:/sapdb
If sapdb does not want to go away (kill kernel.exe serv.exe and wahhtp processes).
Remove the old JDT folder c:/JDT
Remove /usr/sap (might need to stop SAP j2ee server first)
Remove The windows SAP users (2 of them)
Remove The windows SAP groups (3 of them)
Remove c:\program_files\sap_instdir\workplace
Run regedit and delete hkeylocal_machine\software\sap\sapdb_tech (also ZTB etc ..)
Also to force a full reinstall of worplace instead of an upgrade remove c:\windows\sapwksta
