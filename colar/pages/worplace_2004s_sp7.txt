====== SAP developer worplace 2004s SP7 ======

This is a part of this doc: [[workspace 2004s]], **you need to look there first for the patch prerequities.**

See nw2004s_SP_stack_guide_sp07.pdf\\
See note: 879289 (support package guide note)\\
and Note: 891983 (JSPM: Central SAP Note SAP NetWeaver 2004s)\\
WARNING and Note: 933687 (JSPM hanging on windows with SP07)\\

You must have downloaded SP7 from http://service.sap.com/sp-stacks

We have it in\\
\\frenchie/sapcd/patches/nw2004s_patches/sp07/

**Copy**:\\
\\frenchie/sapcd/patches/nw2004s_patches/sp07/* \\
\\frenchie/sapcd/patches/nw2004s_patches/sp07/windows/* \\
into:\\
C:\usr\sap\trans\EPS\in

=====Upgrade the Dev Studio=====

Stop all the SAP system\\
use the sap management console (MMC) to shut down the whole SAP Server (all instances)

cd \\frenchie\sapcd\patches\nw2004s_patches\sp07\studio\J2EE-RUNT-CD\IDE \\
and run ''IDE70Setup.exe''

Once the Installer runs, choose “Update” and complete the install.

=====Upgrade Web AS / Portal / Trex=====

Restart the instance using the sap MMC.

NOTE Start a command prompt this way:\\
Go to Start/Program/Accessories, and Right click on “Command Prompt”, in the contextual menu, select “Run As” \\
A “run as” prompt will popup, select the user ZTBadm.

Now we have a shell where we are logged as ZTBadm (like a unix “su”)

WARNING Do the rest of the patching as ZTBADM using this command prompt

Use JSPM as explained here (or see section 2.2 of the PDF).

WARNING First you might need to fix the SDM (if you are running ⇐SP4): \\

WARNING If you don’t do this patch will fail !\\

See here if you are starting from sp4 or lower on how to do it [[Worplace 2004s sp6]]

If the DB(MaxDB) is not up, start it with SAP MMC \\ 
We also need the SDM up, so start the J2ee node as well \\
wait for the SDM to be started.

Start the JSPM
<code>
cd c:\usr\sap\ZTB\JC00\j2ee\JSPM\
go.bat
#(takes a while for the gui to come up)
</code>

Enter the password to login in the SDM\\
for nwdi package control choose “Not under nwdi” (Only deployment servers are ??)

Choose “single package”\\
and select all the packages and click “next”\\

After JSPM is updated, restart JSPM to continue the update\\
Choose “Support package stack” / “No NWDI control”\\

WARNING **DO NOT Select** "Restore application settings" (as of now it will mess the j2ee engine, and it won';t start anymore if you do - It makes the irj component not start automatically which causes all kind of issues later)\\

Select to use “2004SP7_windowsxx.xml”

Note: if “support package stacks” does not work (does not find any stack), this probably means you are missing some packages (SAR) or that some are corrupted.

Click “Next”, it will run “Check Queue” for a while (=~15mn)

Then it will show what it’s gonna do, at that point make sure you close the MMC if it’s open, then click “Next”

Update should hopefully complete after a while (~5 hours, depending on machine).

NOTE if the JSPM fails see my [[worplace 2004s SP6 | SP6 doc]] for a workaround using the SDM

NOTE it will several time fail (mainly because the j2ee is too slow to restart), try to just press "resume" sometimes it works.\\
If it fails, try "new deployement"

==== Problem fix====
I was getting a hard error, because the component caf/eu/gp/croom/... would fail every time.

Here is the full error message:
<code>
Starting Deployment of caf/eu/gp/croom/content

Resolution:\\
  * Extract (ie: unzip) the SAPEUxxx.sca to a temporary directory (tmp)
  * Start the SDM and go to the deployment tab
  * Click the "+" (add) icon and briwse to tmp/deployarchives/
  * Select ALL the SDA's **EXCEPT** caf.eu.gp.examples.* **AND** caf.eu.gp.croom.*
  * Deploy all those components
  * Leave the SDM
  * **Restart** the J2EE engine
  * Start the SDM and deploy the rest of sap-eu
  * If there are any packages left to patch, Start the JSPM, choose "New deployment" and complete the patch.
