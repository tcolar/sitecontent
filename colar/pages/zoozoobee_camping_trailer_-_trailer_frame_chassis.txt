======ZooZooBee camping trailer - Trailer Frame / Chassis======

TIP: **This is only a part of my full trailer build, see: [[ZooZooBee, My home built Camping Trailer]]**

I Have decided to use this Harbor freight Trailer:
[[http://www.harborfreight.com/1720-lb-capacity-super-duty-48-inch-x-96-inch-utility-trailer-with-12-inch-five-lug-wheels-and-tires-94564.html]]

It's a 4*8 frame rated for up to 1720# of cargo. Bought it using the 20% off coupon for ~320$.

Many others have use it and it's available for in store pickup ( = free shipping)

Since I'm building a 5.6*10 trailer, I modified the frame to be 4*10 by using 2 of the cross members as side extensions, as done by others, like here: [[http://www.mikenchell.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=26296&start=0]] (Thanks Steve for answering my questions)

Here are some pictures of the frame construction:

One weird thing:

The manual says no more than 45mph, the tire rim says no more than 55mph, and the tire rating(M) says no more than 81mph) :)

===The boxes and what's in them===
In comes as 2 boxes, about 5' x 2'.

The smaller box is heavy (framing) - probably close to 150#, The larger one is lighter (wheels, bolts, electrical), maybe 80 pounds.

===Modifying the trailer to be 4' * 10'===
I Used 2 of the cross members on the sides to take the frame length to almost 10' (about 9'9).

Had two drill a few extra holes to bolt the "extensions". It was not very difficult to drill the framing.
