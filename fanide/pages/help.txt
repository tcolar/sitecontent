======Fantom IDE Help /FAQ ======
====FAQ's====
  -**It won't accept my fan_home folder**
Make sure fantom/bin/fan is executable (even for windows until I fix it)
On Unix make sure you ran:
<code>
# wherever you installed fantom
cd /home/me/fantom/ 
sh ./adm/unixsetup
</code>
  - **The Debugger appears buggy**
Sometime when setting a breakpoint it will say something like:
<code>
WARNING: Unable to submit line breakpoint to fan.Debug.Main$doStuff$0 at line 29, 
reason: No executable location available at line 25 in class fan.Debug.Main$doStuff$0.
</code>
But the breakpoint will work anyway.
This is a [[http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=115033|known bug in NB6.7]] (should be fixed in 6.8)
  - **Can I open existing fantom sources.**
A fantom project is recognized as a folder with a build.fan in it (simplistic).
So as long as you have a directory with a build.fan in it, it will be recognized as a fantom project and can be opened.
  -**I'm not used to Netbeans shortcuts / keybindings**
In Netbeans you can go under Tools / Options / Keymap and choose Netbeans, IntelliJ, Emacs or Eclipse keybindings.
You can also customize them to your own likings.
