======JavaOnTracks: Home======
====What is it ?====
I have been developing Java based web applications, small and larges, for over 10 years.
I have found and used(or have had to use) many tools, open-source or not, over the years, some i liked and some not so much.
In other cases i had to write my own tools because there where not any or i did not like the existing ones.
Of some of the tools i liked, i took some of the concepts i liked and wrote my own, often simpler, implementations.
So JavaOnTracks is a compilations of all the tools i wrote that i think would be useful to any java web developer.
That is in other words a "Java web developer toolbox".
Why is it called "JavaOnTracks"? Yes it is a bit of a play on "Ruby on rails" and it does have some features like it, but it is similar to it only in a conceptual way, basically to make your life easier.

What you will find in the JavaOntracks package, is a single easy to use jar file(API) with no dependencies whatsoever(well besides Java), and lots of features/utilities that would normally require many packages and configuration files to get them working.
What you will not get, is a bloated, undocumented, overcomplicated software, requiring you to install lots of other sofware pieces to get it to work. And best of all, in my opinion, no XML files to configure whatsoever.

====Who is it for ?====
Any Java developer who likes saving time by using simple tools that work.
In particular those who feel like other frameworks/tools are in their way rather than helping them, say for example: struts, JSF, giant XML parsers and other things of that nature ... you know what i mean :-)

====What are the Features ?====
Well, the [[Features | Features Page]] is here for that, with links to more details and the API/Javadoc.
In a nutshell here are some of the main features:
