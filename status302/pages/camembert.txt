======Camembert - Lightweight Code Editor / IDE======

Camembert is a Free, [[https://bitbucket.org/tcolar/camembert|Open source]], lightweight IDE, written in Fantom.
It's multi-platform and can run on many platforms (Linux, Max, Windows...)

It supports Fantom projects but also many other projects such as Go, Node.js ,Maven, Python, Ruby etc...

It started as a fork of the BRIE Fantom editor by Brian Frank but has evolved a lot since to add many new features.

The focus is on being a "simple" editor yet provide built-in access to each language documentation as well as running commands.
Over time I have come to realize that the most advanced IDE's, while very effective, tend to make you a bit lazy and often
you will learn a lot more by looking at the proper API documentation than just using completion "blindly".
On the other many hand lightweight editor do not give any built-in access to the documentation at all so if you are somewhet new to a language it will be difficult.
