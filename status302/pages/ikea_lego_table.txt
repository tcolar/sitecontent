======Large Lego Table made from Ikea parts======

Last year I built a [[http://wiki.colar.net/ikea_standing_desk|standing desk]] from Ikea parts that has become very popular online(who knew ?).
 
This year I decided to surprise the kids with a large Lego table for Christmas. Also while my wife is not always excited about the looks of the things I build, but she has liked the Ikea Expedit builds so far, so I stuck to that.

Note that while the standing desk was 100% Ikea parts, this builds uses a few pieces of 2x4 and some moulding and glue, nothing complicated though. 

====Concept====
So basically the main things I wanted:
  - Use Expedit parts.
  - Make that table pretty large for large projects, although you could make it any size.
  - Have a proper table height for the kids (6 and 8). Top of table is about 26'' .
  - have Lego storage built-in.
  - Have "borders" around so Legos won't fall off and get eaten by the vacuum daily.

====Assembly====
I didn't take as many detailed assembly Pictures because i was in a  rush to finish this for christmas (started on the 23rd :-) )

  - First I made legs for the "table" from 2x4's. They are glued and screwed to the underside of the table. See the picture.
  - Then I painted the legs black
  - I cut the moulding to size and painted it black
  - Cut, glued and nailed the moulding to the top of the table and Expedit bookshelves.
  - Installed lego base plates and glued them (lightly).
  - Installed the storage bins and that's about it.
