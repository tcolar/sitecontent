======Netbeans RCP Platform Consulting and Development======

We have experience with the Netbeans RCP platform including developing a [[http://fantomide.colar.net/|full feature plugin]] for the Fantom programming language from scratch.

That included using the newer CSL API's and most of the editor / language API's.

That plugin was released as a Free, Open source project and the sources can be accessed here:
