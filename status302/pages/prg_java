Few random Java bits for now:

- ArrayList : it's an array with a list interface and is best to use most cases.
But can be slower than LinkedList when the array as to be expanded or items removed.
- Vector : (kind of an antique) is synchornized while the other two are not (thread safe but slower)
- LinkedList : is a double linked list (ie: prev linked to next and vice versa).
Faster "in- ordered" traversal and insertions / deletions.
Can use quite a bit more memory(x2) especially on a large dataset.
