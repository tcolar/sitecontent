======SAP Development & consulting (Java / CRM)======

We worked on the SAP Java stack for over 7 years, including working with:

  - SAP ISA (Internet Sales) - B2B and B2C E-Commerce
  - The whole Netweaver Java stack including Web AS, NWDS, NWDI, Portal and more
  - CRM 5.x and 7.x
  - the IPC (pricing) engine
  - Solution Manager

Most of the work done was on improving the SAP E-Commerce offering, that includes greatly enhancing
the functionalities and performance of the B2B and B2C applications with custom implementations such as
enhanced pricing, vanity URL's, data caching and much more.

We also handled some of the system installation and administration tasks (a.k.a basis), in particular of the java based system.

We also did a lot of work on incorporating / mixing some open soure solutions with the SAP Java stack, for example using Sitemesh and JQuery as well as a more open source and agile development stack bringing much higher developer productivity.

While we don't usually write ABAP code, we are knowledgeable enough to read/debug it as needed.
