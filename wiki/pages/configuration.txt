====== JOTWiki Initial Configuration / Setup ======

After completing the [[Installation]], you will have run the initial setup.

**Go to [[http://yourserver:8080/jotwiki/]] this should present you with the setup page.**

TIP: **Depending of which application server you are using and configuration, the port might be other than 8080.
However 8080 is the "standard" java server port (8180 for debian tomcat)**

=====Configuration Steps=====
  * You will get the [[http://www.jotwiki.net/demo_screenshots#main_setup_screen | setup page]], **fill all the fields appropriately** (click the help icons if you need more infos) **and click "Save"**.
The most important things would be: the admin password, your mail server(optional).
  * Then you should **edit the "default" [[http://www.jotwiki.net/demo_screenshots#namespaces_sites | namespace page]]**, in particular the title, web URL etc... and Save
  * **Click "exit setup"**.

WARNING: **It is highly recommended to restart jotwiki (restart the app server) now** so it will pick up all the new settings.


After the restart is complete, you should be able to go back to [[http://yourserver:8080/jotwiki/]] and be presented with your brand new (blank) home page.
**Jotwiki is now up and running and ready to be used !**

===== Using a proxy / Apache in front of the application server =====
Optionally you can use a proxy in front of the application server, for security/performance reason.
This explains how to accomplish this:

The simplest way is to install/enable [[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html| mod_proxy]] and set apache to use it.

Here is an example virtual host file on Debian: (it's the similar on other distros/OS's).
<code | vi /etc/apache2/conf.d/mygreatsite>
<VirtualHost *>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/mygreatsite
  ServerName www.mygreatsite.net

// this passes www.mygreatsite.net requets to jotwiki.
  ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/jotwiki/
// or to go stratight map to a specific namespace:
//  ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/jotwiki/mynamespace/
// don't forget this reverse-proxy line
  ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

</VirtualHost>
