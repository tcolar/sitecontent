======Frequently asked questions and other tips======

=====Finding the cause of a problem=====
The log files are your friend:
Look at /opt/jotwiki/logs/jotwiki.log it most likely as useful information about what the problem is.

TIP: You can go to the "global preferences" and adjust the logging informations, it might be usefull to enable "debug" and "trace" etc.. temporarily to get more informations about the problem. 

=====Debian failure to read/write from the jotwiki data folder=====
FIXME: Explain issues with debian / java policies.

=====Rerunning the initial setup screens / resetting the admin password=====
Once you have complete the original informations, those screen won't show anymore.
If you loose your admin password or somehow break your setup, you can rerun the initial setup by creating a file called "runsetup.txt' in /opt/jotwiki or c:\jotwiki, and restarting the application server.
Then go right away to the webapp (Ex: http://yoursever:8080/jotwiki/) and setup jotwiki.
