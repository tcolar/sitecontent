======JotWiki Installation======
=====Generic concept (all platforms)=====
Jotwiki is a simple java web-application that needs to be deployed to a java application server.
**Download:** jotwiki.zip is avaliable at [[http://bitbucket.org/tcolar/jotwiki/downloads]]
==== Requirements ====
**Here is what you need:**
  - **A java Dev environment (JDK from Sun)** 1.5+
If you don't have java installed yet, or are unsure, see here: [[Installing java]]
  - **A Java Application server**, ie: jetty, tomcat, jboss etc...
If you don't have one yet, see here: [[Installing Jetty]] or [[Installing Tomcat]]
**Make sure your app server is compatible with your JDK version**
  - **A data folder with available disk space** (/opt/jotwiki/ or c:\jotwiki).
The default installation folder is c:\jotwiki(windows) or /opt/jotwiki(other platforms).

NOTE: If you don't want or can't use those standard installation locations, you will need to go through a few extra steps first. See: [[Alternate installation Location]]

==== Installation steps ====
  - **Download jotwiki.zip** from [[http://bitbucket.org/tcolar/jotwiki/downloads]]
  - **Unzip it into a temporary folder** (it will create the jotwiki_installer folder)
  - Go in "jotiwiki_installer" and **Run the installer** (''sudo sh install.sh'' or ''install.bat'')

NOTE: If you want to install jotwiki to a custom folder(not /opt/jotwiki or c:\jotwiki) you will need to start the installer manually, see: [[Alternate installation Location]]


**The installer will ask you a few questions and copy some files to the installation folder.
It will ask you the following:**
  - If you are on a unix platform, it will ask, what is the java app server user(user it runs as), this is so that it can set the jotwiki folder with the proper user/permissions so that jotwiki can read/write to it.
Depending on which app server you are using, this user might be something like: tomcat, tomcat55, jetty, web-data or root(preferably not).
  - It will also ask where your app server "webapps" folder is, this is where web-applications(.war) go, for example for jetty browse to: [JETTY_HOME]/webapps/ , for tomcat someting like /var/lib/tomcat55-webapps/ or /opt/tomcat/webapps/ .
 
After this is done, installation is complete, go to [[http://yourappserver:8080/jotwiki/home]] 
(:8180 on Debian) to get the configuration screens.
