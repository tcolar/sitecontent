======Installing Jetty======
While there might be an installer/package for your operating system, it's just as simple to install jetty manually.
It is very lightweight and just needs to be expanded somewhere and is ready to run.

NOTE: They have Debian and RPM packages available as well, so you can use that if it applies to your OS.

=====Manual install=====
  * **Download Jetty (Latest stable) from:**
[[http://www.mortbay.org/]]
  * **Extract the Jetty archive wherever you want to install it (Ex: in /opt/ or c:\)**

You can then start/stop jetty like this
/opt/bin/jetty start
/opt/bin/jetty stop

=====Jetty Configuration=====
The standard configuration is just fine, and will run jetty on port 8080.
If you want to change that, edit /opt/jetty/etc/jetty.xml and change 8080 for another port.

=====Running as a service=====
If you want jetty to automatically run when you start your OS, you will need a "service" setup:

NOTE: If you used the .deb or .rpm jetty packages, you should already have /etc/init.d/jetty and are good to go.


On windows, you will want to use the Jetty Win32Wrapper, see:
[[http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Win32Wrapper]]

On other unixes, you can add this script(or similar) to your service folder (ex: /etc/init.d:)
<code | /etc/init.d/jetty>
#! /bin/sh

case "$1" in
       start)
               cd /opt/jetty
               java -Xmx256m -Xms256m -jar start.jar etc/jetty.xml &
               echo $! > /var/run/jetty.pid
                ;;
       stop)
                pid=`cat /var/run/jetty.pid`
                kill $pid
               ;;
esac
exit 0
