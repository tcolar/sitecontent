======JOTWIKI - Creating a template======

It is fairly easy to make your own template, basically all you have to do is to "extend" the default template.
If a file/image is found in your template it will be used, otherwise it will use the one from the default template.

You can make one to have your own "style" for jotwiki.

If you make a cool one, it would be nice to share it (see bellow)

=====Getting started=====
The first thing you want to do is to create a new folder in /opt/jotwiki/templates/ for your template.

''mkdir /opt/jotwiki/templates/mytpl/''

You can then set a namespace to use it, so you can test it out.

Also you can download and look at some of the other [[templates]] available as an example.

=====Making a custom Stylesheet=====
The easiest and preferred thing to do to create your own style is to add a custom stylesheet (template.css)

**You should not copy and edit jotwiki.css because that is not very maintanable, instead you will want to create /opt/jotwiki/tempaltes/mytpl/template.css **

In "template.css" you can copy any line you want to modify from jotwiki.css and modify it in here.
Only copy the minimum(what you want to change), so it's more maintainable later.

For example:
<code vi /opt/jotwiki/templates/mytpl/template.css>
# i want the tables to have a red background, instead of #222211 in jotwiki.css
.table{background-color:#ff0000;}
</code>

=====Custom images/Icons=====
The other easy thing you might want to do is use your own images/icons/buttons.

The basic procedure is the same, just put your own image in your template folder.
Say you want your smiling smiley :-) icon (default is /opt/jotwiki/templates/default/images/smileys/smile.gif)
Then just create a new smile.gif image and put it in your template folder (EX: /opt/jotwiki/templates/mytpl/images/smileys/smile.gif)


=====Custom template pages=====
Now if you want to radically change the look, you might have no choice but to change the template pages(HTML) themselves, this is not highly recommended because as jotwiki evolves i will change the pages, it might break your template, so it will be more work to maintain it overtime.

Nevertheless, you can do it, it works the same way as with the other files.

Say you want your own "view.html" (the main template use to render wiki pages), you will want to copy it from the default template (/opt/jotwiki/templates/default/view.html) to your own template /opt/jotwiki/templates/mytpl/view.html and edit here

NOTE: The templates pages are fairly clean HTML, with a few [[http://www.javaontracks.net/home | JavaOnTracks tags]] logic tags (<jot:xx></jot:xx>), you want to be careful not to affect those or you might break the logic/page (that should give you an explicit error about what happened, which should help).

=====Sharing the template=====

You can email me [[mailto:tcolar-wiki@colar.net]] your zipped template folder (the whole folder) and a screenshot (800x600 max) and which jotwiki version it was made for, so i can add it to the [[templates]] page.
